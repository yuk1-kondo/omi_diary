🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1926s - 1937s]
That's on pause a minute. I've got an s due. Oh, let's see. Right. Yeah. So I've got my an essay Jew and Ezekiel. And I told you about it. You did. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1938s - 1940s]
So Yes. Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1942s - 1945s]
Yeah. Our god is initiating the army to come again.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1946s - 1946s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1946s - 1956s]
And then we're gonna break take him down. Well, the middle chunk of Ezekiel is about about God's judgment against the nations. Those who are in opposition to his people.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1957s - 1973s]
But then and then it goes on to how God's gonna restore his people. Then the valley of dry bones and then onto him restoring the temple and all this sort of stuff. Yeah. And then it gets to this this Oracle, they call it, profit a vision where then god of may god rises up.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1974s - 2007s]
But it's different. I don't know, shiny. And but it's some sort of undefined future date to this battle compared to the other ones, which was set in time in history around the time of Ezekiel was writing this one. It's a time where Israel are in the land. They're they're living prosperous and peaceful, and then Gog raises up Omi some all around from Northeast South and Westerny like a stush store there to send on to attack well, to to attack Israel. And then but god absolutely obliterate them.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2008s - 2019s]
And where's that? Well, at point in the future, and that's what we're to decide. So it's I think it's the Some people take it too far and they think it's actually to do the end times and all this.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2020s - 2038s]
But actually, it's more likely realistically Gog is not Gog is a representative of god's enemies and by god enemies, I mean Israel's enemies. In the future, God promised him to protect his people. It's quite it's difficult to say frankly.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2040s - 2046s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2625s - 2626s]
Funnel? Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2629s - 2632s]
Jude, you haven't been drinking up with our two dates.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2633s - 2635s]
Your first side of things the dehydrated is getting hit you. Morning for.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2635s - 2636s]
I got it here.

👤 あなた [2638s - 2639s]
As far as COVID CT are concerned.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2639s - 2648s]
And that point is temp that gap is 10 points and Woo the as well over bolts and wonders and bolts and wonders. Didn't finish like an hour ago.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2648s - 2650s]
You kinda forget a little bit that they can go up in second place.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2652s - 2671s]
They've been, like, obviously, at the top for quite a while now, and, you know, the way they kinda been playing, you just want them to kinda obviously stay there, see it out as champions. But, yeah, I think you have to give a lot of credit to Lincoln. They're on a fantastic run as well, by the way. You know, if it was for them, the league would would kinda be done and dusted now for cardio So they're keeping honest.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2672s - 2714s]
Obviously, Lincoln Jordan today is a nice little bonus for Cardi City, and just gotta keep focuses and concentrate now because there's not too many teams in this league that can really trouble Carter Sea. The only the only kind of team that can maybe, I don't know, cause problems is is themselves. You know, if they take their foot off the gas and get a bit and stuff like that. So so, look, they're on a run. The football that we're kinda watching is is is really, really good. You know, you see many kind of different goalscorers this season and and stuff like that. You know what is very much kind of a a team kind of way of playing from very bad It's it's it's been an amazing turnout. Yes. I know they've dropped down the division.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2715s - 2743s]
And you could see at times just with the quality that courtesy have the squad that have and the way that they play is very difficult for for for most teams in this league, but you do have to give a lot of credit to the manager and to the players as well because the guy is back from kind of relegation, which can really kinda hurt a football club and how quickly they've kinda turned it around in from what we've seen, not just last season, over the last few seasons, I think the managers deserve a lot of credit for that.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2743s - 2744s]
I'm still a bit of work to do, but but, you know, in the right direction is nice to see.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2745s - 2780s]
Yeah. We're gonna hear from Brian Murphy later in the program. We're gonna hear from Christian Fuchs as well and Vitor I know we caught a bit of him, didn't we, speaking at the end of Chris' program, radio as for earlier on, but, we need to hear from you. The call is 03701110 is the number 81012 is the text number you can leave us at at what's voice note. If you don't actually wanna speak to us, that's fine. We won't take it personally. And keeping an eye on all the all the messages on social media, is Jess.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [2780s - 2783s]
Hi, Jess. You're in a nice warm studio.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2783s - 2790s]
Hi, miss say I'm nice and comfortable here. I hope it's not too cold, and that the sun's gone down now. As well. But, yeah, nice to hear But that's very funny.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [2790s - 2824s]
Is cold. I was thinking about you. But, yeah, Cardiffan's the only happy fans today. It looks like Ned says deserved when Joel Cole will rob son, and Chambers, all brilliant. 10 gapped third is nice at this stage of the season. Great for to get some minutes as well. Just a fact, the Swans fan says we got it massively wrong today. We cannot be this timid and spineless away. Team selection has to be more ambitious. Ronaldo needs to go in the summer, but a lot of the players need to look at them themselves before then as well. Their mentality has got to be to go and attack the teams. And a new sports fan says today is the day we've been relegated every other result has gone, a team says Wow.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [2826s - 2829s]
Show no fight at all. Finished.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2831s - 2835s]
Well, that is a damning assessment, isn't it, of Newport County.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2835s - 2872s]
We're gonna we are gonna hear from from Christian Fuchs later on. But anyone we discussed Newport County at length, and we are on the feast of football podcast. I think until today, I think I've been to every everyone but one of games this season. And although, you know, they picked up a point at home to Grimm's What what was going in their favor was that the the teams in and around them weren't winning either, and we've seen the difference that makes today because Harrogate will the teams have picked up points around them, haven't they? And now that, you know, from from being in touch, now five points five points from safety.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2875s - 2876s]
Christian Phillips keeps coming out with with these little gems of of wisdom, We're not on a allegation battle when the when the question was asked, when they quite clearly were, when they've spent sent me with a better team against Swindon near than I did.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2884s - 2909s]
You call Ian Holloway's reaction to that. I did. And I I totally with it. Although I do think they should have had a penalty Yeah. Before before Swindon saw a broken score. Although, saying that, the reaction after penalty not given seconds later, the goal keeps picking the ball up, isn't it? You know, that's why they're in a position that they are I've heard the goal today is to stop you once while I play out the bark, you know.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2909s - 2912s]
Not an allegation battle.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2915s - 2916s]
I think this week, came out and said that he's got he's got forward players that could score goals, but they haven't scored their last three.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2924s - 2927s]
Sounds like an annoying taken the job because I think he was on a hide into that thing.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2927s - 2928s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2928s - 2940s]
They've done from the season before due to come, I think they finished the lab, then they've gone from eleventh to 15 to 18 to twenty seven seconds.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2940s - 2941s]
Twenty second. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2941s - 2955s]
Just just just been a downward spiral for for for three seasons. But one, if not the lowest budget, budget in the division, and they just lack quality all over the pits, sadly, and that's why they're in the position. It pays me to say it.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2956s - 2984s]
I just can't see them getting out of trouble. Well, they are rock bottom above lead two. 21. How do get one point above them have been played one extra game? Then Crawley Town are the next team along. Five points ahead of Newport County that's the predicament they find themselves in. It wants to tell us about their of Christian Fukus' quotes from the last couple of weeks. Why don't we hear what got to say now? He's been speaking to our reporter, Mark Poiser.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [2985s - 2987s]
Chris, how do you reflect on that today?

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [2990s - 3008s]
Yeah. It's it's the common theme that we are, you know, between the boxes, but then we're not good enough in either box. We make a a crush mistake again in the first or second minute of the game. That cost us. And then we don't take our chances and when you play against teams.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [3009s - 3017s]
Away from home that are that high in the table to have good momentum, then you need to take the chances that they're that I presented yourself.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [3019s - 3033s]
Know, the characters, the team is there. They they kept going until the day and creative creative. Chances themselves. I think especially towards or in the second half, we're we're the better team overall, and, unfortunately, it pay off again.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [3033s - 3041s]
But, again, you walked into a dressing room. The boys are upset. For for the ride reads. Right? Because they they see what they are looking for.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [3042s - 3042s]
For and how much it goes.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3056s - 3060s]
It's gonna be I stopping in the coconut arms? On the coconut shop in my hands. So I think that's where Well,

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3063s - 3067s]
Blimey. Way too fast.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [3067s - 3073s]
Well, defensively as well. On the other side of the pitch. You know, we need to go in in every training and every game to the point.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3074s - 3076s]
So you you're having for T, right?

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [3076s - 3081s]
How do you go about

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [3081s - 3082s]
Oh, yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3084s - 3086s]
What time do you think you'd be backtracking be back for tea time.

👤 あなた [3086s - 3089s]
Mean, I'm I'm wondering if I'm gonna wait out or Oh.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [3089s - 3089s]
Really?

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [3100s - 3103s]
The voice understand that this is a very crucial moment in our ticket is.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3104s - 3108s]
As you touched on an old fulfillment of the building for this minute, but Very positive.

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [5301s - 5314s]
And we just need to continue to trend. We to keep going, and, you know, it's not a big opportunity for us. Coming Tuesday, it's all for us to to put things right.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5317s - 5318s]
Oh, was there any trying to inject some positivity

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [5314s - 5316s]
County manager Christian Fuchs.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5319s - 5379s]
into another if we another another goal as performance. Would you make an argument, Robert? He's got to be to be fair. He's got to try and get to play with midday, be lower than a snake's belly at the minute. They're off the way. They're going away. I mean, a certain way When we or when? It lead to Alright. Which is a test.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5379s - 5380s]
Week.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5380s - 5384s]
So we're doing anything for his twenty third. On the package. I think you got the place to do it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5399s - 5401s]
Seeing him not They can't they can't

👤 あなた [5401s - 5402s]
He's an adult now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5404s - 5406s]
I can understand him trying to be as positive because he's got a that we manage the same kind of have.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5413s - 5417s]
No seems like Oh, even the same.

👤 あなた [5423s - 5431s]
Maybe a slot should do something from them and make Paul kind of be a bit embarrassed about about it. Ian Hollow, said, yeah, they did. Maybe I should speak to my mom and say should we book a meal with all the Just down this week.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5435s - 5443s]
You're trying to go a different way for you, Good. Different type of kind of management in David Sheep and Christian Keeps and as well. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5445s - 5470s]
Obviously, trying to go different way with the style of play, but then you look at the budget for the players It's probably you know, they were all the lowest kinda in the league anyway, but it's it's capped got even lower now with So you're trying to do a certain thing, as you even said, with players that are are not of doing it. You know, players that have never some players who have not even played at that level, not played and that type of pressure Stay with me. At that level either.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5470s - 5478s]
Yeah. Then I I just find it just baffling to me even your Christian pewter kinda coming in again. Special plans to get a munch

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5483s - 5500s]
It's you know, they've he's gotta get something right. You know, problems in both boxes gotta get one of those right. You gotta start scoring or you know, if I'm him coming in after they've used and we're shipping of goals, the first thing I'm gonna work on is not in between both, but It's making sure they're keeping more clean sheets.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5501s - 5512s]
Because if you're not scoring doors the other end, if you need clean sheets, you've got a better chance of picking up points So you make the odd goal, and then you're all quite difficult to beat. You know, what what they probably needed was Greg Coxland coming back for the heat, probably after But he was out of work.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5519s - 5543s]
He's immediately orbit, but they've gone down this different route of attractive for well, I'm all this. And there's nothing worse than playing you, and I'll tell you. I'm feeling like you play well, still lose. You'd rather be bad and and lose games. You know, if you feel, oh, yeah. We've done alright today, but we've helped the tish again where we've conceded to, like, take it out. It's even more than our life But but when I read comments from Newport County fans who've watched the game and they hear what Christian Foods is gonna say, they they don't recognize what he's saying.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5547s - 5554s]
They they don't think they're playing well in Newport County Bunch. Can give us a ring to to tell us yourself. Those 370-1110.

👤 あなた [5554s - 5555s]
Oh, yeah. You're probably gonna to division.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5555s - 5561s]
You're not talking about the center of some of the comments. These don't like yeah. We play it. It died. I don't know. I I I I get it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5565s - 5584s]
Fans of don't see a good performance if you've lost title, think. They don't see a good performance if you're if you're not testing your position to go keeper. The one we do for me, we've spoken numerous times about it, She loves their better performances this season. The folks come away from home, and there's a massive problem at Rodney Parade. Well, there were two games there all season.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5585s - 5589s]
They went to went to probably a boxing play, really good performers.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5590s - 5603s]
Bromley, I don't know where needed what they were at the time. Top in the league. They lose two one, clearly unlucky to come away. And then a few weeks ago, they went to field against Jillian, winning the game, ordered an injury tire.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5603s - 5605s]
What happens?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5606s - 5611s]
They can see a lack of concentration, organization, whatever, or they can see two goals of injury type.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5612s - 5628s]
So to get nothing out of those two games, And then last week, they took it last week when he has cropted goalkeeper safer keep it at Neilville. But when little things like that are going against you, when you're playing well, and they did play well against probably, you, look at and you're still coming out empty, haven't you?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5628s - 5631s]
And empty, haven't That is that is one of the issues as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5632s - 5645s]
Teams how they play, and they'll be they'll be fine to be, okay. Yeah. Gonna they play good football. Okay. We'll just be organized and make it difficult for them Let me just get the ball in their box so we know that they'll, you know, concede a goal.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5645s - 5665s]
So it's it's it works the other way as well. Yeah. Well, it's able to do in it as in Newport County. At bottom of it, let's hear from you. Newport Port County fans, what do you what do you wanna say about the the flight of your club at the moment? Jess, anymore Newport dissolution, Newport County fans there? Or any positive ones even?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [5665s - 5688s]
Not much braise online for who put performances on. Have the times of meeting because there's no idea how to coach us. I'll give him one thing though. He was right about us not being in a allegation battle because he's taken us out to one. There's no fight in this team, no battle. Elsewhere, Thomas says not good enough today, and it is rather concerning that we can't seem to pick up themselves against those teams above us.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [5688s - 5704s]
Opportunity missed and gutted to concede from two corners, which was ultimate the difference today. Frustrating Oh, an accent. And a cardiffect did. Jewel Cole will prove it again that of all our current crop of young talent, He's the one that continues to shine most brightly. Great times ahead with his group of players, hopefully.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5706s - 5720s]
Okay, Jess. Yes. Joel made made a way for his brother, Ruben Cole, didn't he, today returning from injury let's say, a carniff fundman. And from Kefili has given us Hello. I've known you for me in a couple of weeks. How are you?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [5721s - 5723s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5754s - 5756s]

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [5756s - 5767s]
He's play he's not and he's he's go he's just said they've left the ball go, but now he's playing and going, after the ball goes. I'm quite impressed with him. Well, I'm quite

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [5772s - 5783s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5799s - 5802s]
You must be enjoying what you'll see in that.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [5802s - 5804s]
I'm because the football got all these in the right body whenever they No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5821s - 5825s]
Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. They they went with ten men as well. That's it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [5833s - 5849s]
Playing as a team, and actually to when they follow ball, the ball, the the casting was every first half and second second half. We still still we would have won it. But I mean, we we play in the hope to pull up to the the two halves. You know?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [5850s - 5853s]
I wanna when is they clean the the I used up when he's down.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [5853s - 5855s]

And then when we get into these jumpstick again, it get the same manager, Brian, and then we'll we'll give them, like, we'll give them a little judge judge. I would I would I would skip in in a championship. But Gary. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5886s - 5901s]
I when they were about 10 players after twenty minutes when when we got set off. That's the one of the best performances if not the best when the team got a player less advantaged if that makes sense. They would yeah. Absolutely. They would outstanding.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5901s - 5905s]
They are absolutely dominated the game from from from then on to Scott three.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5906s - 5910s]
Top class goals. Could've could've got more.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [5910s - 5910s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5911s - 5919s]

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [5919s - 5950s]
He's putting that ball into the center, and more than he's ever once he's gone to them in the past, he's gonna go, no. He's following it, getting the ball back, which is to me is so much better now. You're going to shake his hand because, you know, they say, it's it's it's nice to see it, especially on the first tiny when our lady was following our board. You know?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [5955s - 5967s]
Doesn't he, Danny? But one one thing that you you you have to say about he he is improving players. It it it feels to me it's been a while since there's been a a coach, manager, or everyone I call it here, who has improved the players he's got.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [5967s - 5967s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5967s - 5976s]
And I've been saying this for a while as well. You know, obviously, the last kind of few seasons has been difficult being a cut seed band. Been difficult for us at times. Know?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5978s - 5990s]
Watching games, commentating on games. It wasn't always exciting when you saw you were chatting sent to Cardiff, was it? Not, like, kinda seeing any no. It wasn't really. It wasn't. And not really seeing any go on I tell you all as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [6018s - 6029s]
We'll run two kind of brick walls for both. So, you know, probably by where if he's doing it, they very kind of modern day kind of way, the players kinda love it. You can see that it's such a well coached team.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [6030s - 6058s]
And it's it's what I kinda said for a while whereas, you know, there's been so frustrations over the last few seasons, obviously, with the hierarchy and stuff that had some of the making. But I always said if they can get the right type of kind of management, we could the players and get them played a certain way, then you're still capable of kind of doing well and having kind of success. And I know, obviously, now we've we're down in league one. And with the squad that we have, you know, I expect to to be where we are, but it's kinda the way that they kinda go in about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [6059s - 6084s]
The things that the clubs kinda made implemented in the summer with the manager coming in, young players being given an opportunity, the proud of the kind of football. It's it's just it's been a real big too. I've been really impressed how quickly the manager's been able to kinda get his kind of and his points across to the place. So quickly. Yeah. And underway the players have yeah. And how they've to that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [6085s - 6106s]
And how they've come in develop So it's like it's like they it's like they really wanted. They couldn't get enough of it because don't know whether it you know, I don't wanna speak ill of of of previous managers here, but when when you hear the players say what they appreciate from Brian Murphy, it kind of gives you a hint of of something that they maybe weren't getting from from other coaches. Yeah. And then I'm a top honking onto him, man.

👤 あなた [6266s - 6266s]
Brian's interview.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [6266s - 6270s]
We're a team on four coming into this game. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6270s - 6276s]
Such a dangerous team that we had to be really focused on what we had to do and really great for that to pairs supposed to do the practice on the plan.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [6276s - 6280s]
How good were attacking performance in the in the first half?

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6280s - 6299s]
I think it's I think it's really good to think, you know, we went through the game. We knew we'd have a huge backyard today, the supporters would get behind us once they felt That way we wanted to play how we did. And in the second half, we had to, I suppose, understand the nature of the game and we have a spell where there's good possession. But we limited them to a person, but I know goal, and that's as pleased as the goals respond.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [6299s - 6306s]
All these goals came in the first half, A pecular bench, the one by Perry Angie. What a goal by a right back. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6306s - 6325s]
I must confess I thought Perry should have passed it, but luckily for me he did listen to me. And he's capable of doing that. And I think, you know, we don't we want robots here. I mean, has to use to tell him what's right and and tell actually have the skill to to perform that goal is is a testament to the he is. You know, he's a player that we believe will score goals and should score goals.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6326s - 6333s]
Technical ability he has. No before or February's quarter season, and we should be goals in years.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [6333s - 6338s]
We're done. Joel Coleville has scored the set. Line up. We've been making is development this season.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6338s - 6342s]

👤 あなた [6342s - 6345s]
The good news is the lights will only go on when the are closed.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6345s - 6353s]
He's doing, you know, he's incredible mentality to improve every single day and and arrive he arrives in the box a lot. You know, and and then he has to be able to match.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [6359s - 6360s]
I'm listening to Barry. Have you got a key?

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6361s - 6366s]
Most of our squad is the amount of improvement that they can do is is something they share with us.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [6366s - 6374s]
His brother, Ruben, came on in the second half. Also came on. I'm pleased is it to see them coming back into the fold?

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6374s - 6375s]
Yeah. We want haven't got a big squad.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [6375s - 6376s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6376s - 6386s]
By number, so we we want all those players feel as if they can challenge in place soon as possible. Ruby's probably a a little bit different to Dylan because Dylan's been on for a short period. Ruben's been on for a long time.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6387s - 6389s]
To get him back in is a huge boost or so.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [6389s - 6398s]
You haven't lost the game since Lincoln back in in December. Does it feel like it's just a matter of time now before you secure promotion back to the championship?

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6398s - 6405s]

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [6424s - 6439s]
No. Not close. Youssef's back back with us. He was here today, but he hasn't rejoined the team for training yet. Until he does that, we won't really have a time scale. I think we have an of that nature. We have to be really patient and make sure that his neck and and surrounding areas are ready at the moment he's done.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [6440s - 6444s]

👤 あなた [6776s - 6783s]
That's quite fancy then. Hello, Jude? You okay? Yeah. Good.

👤 あなた [6845s - 6849s]
Hello. Do something with that ball, so you can't just put it by the side.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6894s - 6927s]
Place in a huge residual city populated by a bit over a million NPC. I've been talking about my progress on the NPCs for a while now and at this point I am finally considering them future completes on a technical level. Meaning, they can now do everything a game character should be able to do. They have fun functioning work and home schedules and are able to navigate the city and get from one location to another pretty reliably. They have basic idle that allow them to use the furniture in their vicinity to rest when they don't have a goal to get to. They have a fully functioning dialogue system so the player can talk to any of them.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6927s - 6946s]
They also react to other kinds of player actions such as hitting them, throwing object at them, or pestering them too much. I've also added a registry of non NPCs that displays known information about them and be filtered to show only favorite NPCs. And most recently, I've added the ability for the NPCs to pick up both the existing objects

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6950s - 6996s]
But there is one glaring problem that still remains before I can say that the MPCs are ready to be playtested. Which is that they are just not much fun right now. And this is the problem I really want to solve before I show you guys the results of my work for the past what, eight months or so? I do have some ideas in mind. But first, big thanks to my patrons on Patreon. Despite pitching my game to publish thing that would be a huge improvement is simply adding more content to the existing ations up until now, so the functionality is all there and it's quite versatile. But I still need to add variety to the actual behaviors.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6997s - 7024s]
For now, the NPCs can only do two things. They walk from one place to another, and and they sit around when they don't have a place to go. I don't even have any work animations for the ones I work right now, so that's something on my priority list. I also want to add interactions with the environment, like buying soda from the vending machines, or reading the tablets and magazines scattered around the city. Of course, I ideally, there'd have to be more complex routines that make sense from the person's point of view to make them more realistic, not just random.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [7024s - 7077s]
Actions. For example, a character that stops for leisure on the way home would want to go a cafe and eat something at a shop for grocery then maybe a bar or a gym depending on their personality. But I don't think I'm there yet. Another improvement would be the dialogue. The system for it is fully implemented, but the lines themselves right now is a simple neutral greeting, which can result in the NP introducing themselves and becoming an acquaintance, sometimes sharing their life troubles in ask them how they're doing, and sometimes refusing to speak to the player if they are in the country. I also add a special dialogue with her and her nature. But all of this dialogue so far only serves one practical purpose. Finding character multiple times will be necessary to build a relationship with them.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [7078s - 7080s]
On. What I want to do now is add fun and

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [7085s - 7097s]
I'm trying to do that and what exactly I'm going to write, but I think it'll be a great that isn't technical for once. The third thing that I realized I'm missing is something that is essential for a game that's all about an urgent gameplay.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [7098s - 7120s]
Which is spontaneous events. I'm thinking about the greatest emergent gameplay game that I've ever played, Kenshi. In this game, there are no quests and very little dialogue, but the world is never boring. All due to one thing, unpredictability. You can travel the same route many times and you never know who we are going to run into and what it events we are going to witness. And I'd like my game world to be like this.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [7120s - 7175s]
Ideally, as you simply traverse the city, you might witness unique events happening around you for example, NPCs having arguments or committing a crime or having a party, all of which could unlock special dialogue and potential special rewards if the player chooses to engage. But, of course, I would need to make sure these events won't become repetitive and predictable. At this point, I have no idea how I'm going to do that, but I guess I will record another devlog about once I figure it out. Then, of course, a great thing to add would be relationships that the NPCs could have with each other. But my current systems really support the financing, and I don't think I will be coming that route. I'm not making sense after all. I will be adding conversations and gestures between characters do you think would be a fancy season or fun to watch him with Jack with apart from simply adding more content. Are there any obvious ideas that didn't occur to me? Let me know. And of course, stay creative.
