Who It does.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [225s - 225s]

👤 あなた [225s - 230s]
Anyways, have a good day. Let me know. Let let me know how your appraisal goes,

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [230s - 230s]
Rachel.

👤 あなた [232s - 233s]
But I You're not.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [234s - 242s]
But If you cannot compare, me and interrupting because I want to tell you that I'm thirsty to there's a door wide open. I'm sorry. That little door needs to be showing.

👤 あなた [242s - 251s]
Yes. I know it's open. I was, like, about to explain to you why it was open. You just heard me that you never open front door, come up, says, grab someone, go back down with them.

👤 あなた [252s - 256s]
Honey. And the door, which you didn't even see I see. Was No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [256s - 257s]
You were you were there.

👤 あなた [258s - 260s]
Yeah. I was here. You never walked out and looked.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [260s - 264s]
Well, no. Did because then I followed you and I saw how far why it was open.

👤 あなた [264s - 266s]
It wasn't even far wide open.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [266s - 297s]
It was wasn't completely open like that, but it was to come say, honey, I I I I I I I understand that you don't wanna be talking to me, and I'm working on that. But that situation is complete it's two completely different things. Now obviously, if you perceive that there's no risk to door be open, you're gonna think it was a point that's interruption and not fair. I clearly perceive that risk to be way higher than you do, but that's always been the case. You've never had a problem with things being on. I'm saying, don't think that door wrote for why she used it. Because my handbag's hanging up. You're like, well, it's fine. You're always gonna take your handbag.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [298s - 304s]
So we clearly we had a different perceived risk of the situation. Just why I was cheating it with more urgency than you were.

👤 あなた [306s - 307s]
Do Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [307s - 308s]
You do wanna get into it, do you?

👤 あなた [312s - 315s]
I've already I've I've already explained to you that understand why you did it, Rachel.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [323s - 323s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [323s - 326s]
But you can't link it in with every character flaw.

👤 あなた [327s - 328s]
Every time I So every character flaw is yours.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [329s - 339s]
Because I can go all by the way meet you who would is really important, and that's not that important. You cannot combine it with that. Maybe that's that's two completely different things.

👤 あなた [344s - 345s]
Let's have look here, dude.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [22s - 29s]
Just just a quick just a quick follow-up, Stefan, if I can. That was very interesting. Because, obviously, we're talking about the the right of the the apostles to reinterpret.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [30s - 54s]
Supposedly scripture in a way that we cannot cannot reproduce. But connected to that, I'm wondering about are they also modeling how scripture is meant to be read to us and thus in some ways, scripture is meant to be accessible to to fishermen, as well as Leonard. But on saying that, fishermen, as you've already pointed out, would have known the Psalms really well and possibly more so. We don't have that today.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [55s - 85s]
So in a sense of modeling how we read scripture or even as preachers how we you know, approach scripture in this way. Are we are they are the apostles modeling for us then a way which we're meant to be reading scripture and thus right. So in that sense, it isn't just kind of something we can't reproduce. In fact, we we should be doing so, but on on the foundation of of good knowledge of of the of the Old Testament particularly as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [4s - 19s]
So I go to a church in Japan, and last week after the they handed out these papers, and they had a meeting. And it's basically a financial breakdown of absolutely all the money that has come in to the church down to the yen, so down to the cent. It says how much money they had left over from events.

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [19s - 28s]
And then on the other side, it has everywhere that they spent money, And, again, it's down to the very end, so you know where absolutely all the money is going.

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [28s - 43s]
It's super transparent. It's super honest. I think it's great. It's it's a good safeguard against any kind of corruption it's good beneficial for people to know where the money is going when they're giving. Yeah. I'm curious. What country are you in?

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [43s - 54s]
Does your church have something like this? Do you think it's a good idea? Do you think more churches should be doing this, or do you think it's none of nobody's ease wax where my goes and they should just be happy giving?

So I'll watch those videos in advance and then we can you know, have a more kind of informed chat about it I guess. In answer to the the short, I'm all for financial, you know, what's the word I'm looking for? Transparency, that's the word.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [120s - 148s]
My only thoughts are is that we'd want to you know, be careful about it in the sense that how we present it in terms of where an elder led church or we're certainly going to be. And so we want to be open and transparent about how we spend the money. But equally not invite too much input into people's opinions on that unless it was unless it was, you know,

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [154s - 180s]
Hey Ben, thank you for sending those through. Yes, lunch on Thursday sounds good. I can't remember whose turn it is to bring lunch. I'm happy to do so. If it's if if that works. And I'll watch the the finance videos that you put together. I haven't yet. I did plan to watch them Friday, but I had to bump them along I'm But I'll do that in advance of Thursday. So we can, have an informed chat about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [182s - 193s]
So that's I believe that's 12:12 o'clock, isn't it? Regarding that short, I I'm really for the principle of transparency. Oops. Shown's at the door. One sec.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [202s - 202s]
Hello, mate.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [204s - 205s]
Cheers, man. Thank you, mate.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [213s - 230s]
Yeah. Sorry about that. Delivery man. Yeah. I'm all for transparency. I'm very happy to do that. And I think something that I've I've wanted to do, and we have done actually in the past when Andy was here, was produce some sort of reports that broke down the the, you know, how we spent the money.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [232s - 243s]
Tied in with kind of like an annual kind of presentation of the church as finances and maybe a bit of vision casting, if I can use that word for the for the coming year.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [245s - 277s]
So we kind of pray about it as a leadership and think about how we wanna spend the money how we what we have vision for and faith for and then any shortfall we present to the church and at that point then they also receive a report from the previous year. My only questions I guess about how we do this is we want to be transparent but in we are an elder led church as opposed to a kind of more of a Baptist member model kind of church. So in that sense, accountability is important.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [281s - 292s]
How we invite that accountability and who we're accountable to is also important. So what am I trying to say there?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [296s - 315s]
I guess I want to share with the church how we spend the money so they can be informed in their prayers and things like that. But not necessarily invite opinion on how we are to spend the money. That is a leadership decision, I guess. So maybe we can think about how we do that presentationally.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [315s - 331s]
But, I'm all for I'm all for accountability. I'll I'll also probably want to because that's quite an important matter to get right, maybe chat with some of the mentors about it. I'll advance churches approach financial transparency.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [332s - 339s]
And maybe we can then have a chat about it. Anyway, mate. Hope that makes sense. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday midday.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [339s - 343s]
And I can bring lunches. Cheers, man.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [343s - 343s]
Bye.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [345s - 348s]
Hey, Ben. Thank you for sending those through.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [348s - 372s]
Yes. Lunch on Thursday sounds good. I can't remember whose turn it is to bring lunch. I'm happy to do so. If it's if if that works, And I'll watch the the finance videos that you put I haven't yet. I did plan to watch them Friday, but I had to bump them along, I'm afraid. But I'll do that in advance of Thursday so we can, have an informed chat about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [374s - 376s]
So that's I believe that's 12:12 o'clock, isn't it?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [380s - 388s]
Regarding that short I I'm really for the principle of transparency. Oops. I was at the door. One sec. Yeah. Sorry about that. Delivery man.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [389s - 389s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [389s - 402s]
I'm all for transparency. I'm very happy to do that. And I think that's something that I've I've wanted to do. I'm we have done actually in the past when Andy was here, was produce some sort of reports that broke down the copper, you know, humming at the moment.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [416s - 416s]
The coming year.

👤 あなた [418s - 433s]
So we kind of pray about it as a leadership. And think about how we wanna spend the money, how we what we have vision for and faith for and then any shortfall we present to the church. And at that point, then they also receive a report from the previous year.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [434s - 435s]
My only, crush at How are you?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [446s - 449s]
You alright? Good. Thank you. Thank you. Alright. Thanks.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [449s - 450s]
Thank you very much. You too.

👤 あなた [469s - 483s]
My only, questions, I guess, about how we do this is want to be transparent, but in we are an outlet church as opposed to a kind of moral of practice member model kind of church.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [483s - 486s]
So in that sense, accountability is important, but how we invite that accountability and who we're comfortable too is also important.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [497s - 501s]
So so what am I trying to say? There?

🎤 SPEAKER_23 [504s - 508s]
I guess I want to share with the church how we spend the money so they can be informed in their prayers and things like that.

🎤 SPEAKER_23 [508s - 547s]
But not necessarily invite invites opinion on how we are to spend them in. That is a leadership decision, I guess. Guess. So maybe we can think about how how we do that presentationally. But, yeah, I think I'm all for accountability. I'll also want to because it's quite an important matter to get right, maybe chat with some of the mentors about it, might have power over our advantage to approach financial transparency, and maybe we can then have a chat it. Anyway, mate, hope that makes sense. I'll look forward to seeing you after Thursday midday, and I'll bring lunches.

🎤 SPEAKER_23 [548s - 549s]
Cheers, man.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [0s - 1s]

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [23s - 24s]
DoorDash.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [74s - 75s]
I know you too.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [75s - 84s]
I just tried your hardest. But for me, that didn't really cut it. So get out of my lane. Sit behind that desk.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [141s - 148s]
And I think that it is disgraceful that there's a celebration tonight a loser.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [153s - 153s]
But I understand.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [155s - 161s]
You people feel for those losers. Your lifetime losers like Bill Gilbert.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [164s - 167s]
Loses like John C.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [170s - 173s]
Ena and lose us like AJ Styles.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [176s - 184s]
And what they all have in common, is that I killed a career.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [188s - 195s]
So what should really happen here tonight? Is a celebration for a truly great wrestler.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [197s - 197s]
Me.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [197s - 200s]
That is enough. Enough. They're great.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [215s - 216s]
Goddamn it.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [223s - 231s]
I knew you'd come out here trying something like that. We are not gonna do that. Well, we are gonna do is we are gonna celebrate the career of AJ Styles.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [237s - 240s]
So you're done. Get out of the ring.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [240s - 243s]
Call the night I'm having my boys escort you out of this building right now.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [255s - 270s]
I am going to leave. But not because you tell me. Because out of my free will, I decide to leave this building because I'm by what is going to happen here tonight.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [275s - 276s]
Puxa-la aí.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [282s - 287s]
Well, Cory, I I can't say I shocked it. Thought they were up to the proceedings tonight.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [297s - 306s]
Gucker retired Goldberg at the beginning of this career killer stance for Gucker. And unfortunately, as bitter of a pill as it is to swallow, Thompson does speak a great deal of truth.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [308s - 309s]
The man is ending legendary careers.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [311s - 312s]
I I don't agree with this choice.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [313s - 314s]
The disrespect styles already tonight, but I'm not gonna stop right there.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [319s - 320s]
And kudos to our general manager to get gutter out of here.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [327s - 342s]
Dragon League is just Dragon League. Dragon League attacking Gunther. On the night that his friend AJ Styles, his former tank team, and he takes it upon himself to attack Goku.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [345s - 352s]
And he's tired of the disrespect being displayed towards Stiles by Gotham. You're not Dragon Lee.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [392s - 393s]
It's not your night.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [473s - 475s]
A large charger spawn.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [475s - 481s]
Cody Rose kicking the slot tonight on Monday night, he's got a lot on his mind, Corey.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [495s - 506s]
That man right there, Cody Because just like everyone Atlanta, like you, like you, like you,

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [516s - 521s]
When Robinson wins tonight, wins the elimination chamber, and wince at WrestleMania.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [525s - 528s]
The vision's taken over SmackDown two.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [531s - 533s]
And you, Cody Rhodes, are the first guy out the door.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [541s - 541s]
However, god bless all of you because you're here in our presence.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [544s - 548s]
And that all starts when Bronson Reed wins his

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [559s - 562s]
I don't know. I don't know.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [566s - 570s]
I'm pretty sure there's someone here who would disagree with that.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [609s - 611s]
Big bronseter who is incredibly agile.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [621s - 624s]
Steel post match other men's side in the history of the chamber.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [624s - 627s]
And with a forearm drop in Jeyousa.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [629s - 635s]
Your eyes on the original. Run to Americano who's perched on the top turnbuckle. Look out below.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [637s - 639s]
Saw takes out a Omi and Reed.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [641s - 641s]
You have to wonder what man standing.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [646s - 650s]
It's elimination style. The last man standing heads direct

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [651s - 653s]
Sylvania.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [653s - 664s]
You know, true maggot. He's his chops, and he'll be watching every moment of that match up fold. With his WrestleMania hopes on the line. Hey, Richie. Oh, inside cradle. Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [664s - 665s]
Enough to put him away.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [665s - 671s]
And, like Our shoulders were up there. I mean, Jay actually initiated the inside cradle that was countered by Americano.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [672s - 679s]
Americano has never been a part of the elimination chamber, which to qualify for the first time this year. You know, wicked chop.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [679s - 681s]
Delivered to Lead event, Jey Uso.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [684s - 692s]
And we were top office earlier. You could really feel the pressure the stress of WrestleMania season fifty four nights away Oh. In Las Vegas.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [694s - 703s]
Listen to Jay. Why did it in pain? Beautiful. Bridging hammer lock applied by Americano. Number Jay taps here.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [703s - 703s]
It's over.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [704s - 711s]
Would have to be disappointing for Big Bronx to to not even be involved in the fall and still lose an opportunity at the chain And and talk about pressure.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [711s - 716s]
I mean, there's a lot of read as well. Really, the future with the vision.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [716s - 717s]
Yeah. You're right.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [719s - 723s]
The the last hope for representation on the stage of the mall could be Big Bronson Reed. Jay Fight.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [723s - 725s]
Oh, come on, Jay.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [726s - 731s]
Las Vegas. Listen to Jay. Why didn't he paint?

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [734s - 737s]
Really, the future with invention. Yeah. You're right, man.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [737s - 741s]
Last hope for representation on the grandest stage of the mall could be a big grandson read.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [742s - 754s]
K. Fight back. With one arm and Goande will stop him again. And this is great strategy by Uso and Rande to take out of the mix at least momentarily turn this into a one on one matchup.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [757s - 760s]
Focusing his attack on the left arm with Jay Huso.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [761s - 769s]
And, hopefully, we've settled things down here in Atlanta as we prepare to celebrate the great AJ styles of it later on tonight. Oh, what a kick.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [783s - 790s]
USO and Americano have done a great job keeping out of the majority of this matchup and making this one on one unleashed a hellacious right hand on the chin of Americano.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [797s - 807s]
Again, he's three men battling now to the final spot in Saturday's elimination chamber. Jay looking to return to the main event of WrestleMania yet again.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [808s - 819s]
The battle for a championship. I'm talking to you last year. And the three hundred thirty pound also in the wagon. Big headbutt.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [822s - 824s]
Look at the power of big Bronx and Reed. Oh my god.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [825s - 826s]
Oh my god.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [826s - 826s]
Double stacked.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [828s - 832s]
And now, and marching around the ring. Look at the power of Brush and

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [833s - 833s]
Reed.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [835s - 837s]
It's verifying strength.

👤 あなた [838s - 838s]
Not ready.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [838s - 855s]
There's a reason that the Oracle Paul Heyman picked Reed to be a part of this vision. Steph Rollins, who was the original leader of the group, Imagine what Bronson Reed can do inside the elimination chain.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [855s - 861s]
Got a glimpse of it a couple of years ago back in 2023 when he battled for the United States championship inside the championship.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [863s - 865s]
This is a different competitor altogether.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [865s - 874s]
Covered here by Look for the way. You're kicking at two. Ironically, in that chamber match that he was in, Austin was The United States He'd go on to win.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [874s - 893s]
And, again, another superstar who has completely altered their outlook, their vision, no pun intended, on WWE. The future of this industry Big Bronson Reed said, enough being background noise. It's time to be the main carry And that's what we've seen our read over the past several months. This man is lethal.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [893s - 897s]
Look at Paul and a good point earlier. The vision has been dominating Rise of Blade.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [898s - 902s]
Imagine if Thompson Reed wins the chamber, goes on to win the WWE title in WrestleMania then?

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [903s - 905s]
It's not a proper trip now.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [919s - 926s]
World's strongest slam delivered that time by The fact that Americano just scramble his own grains and then pull this off I champion against this guy.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [927s - 927s]
Wow.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [936s - 948s]
The power of the original El Grande Americano is unreal. Just delivered a German suplex to the three hundred thirty pound Bronson Reed to turn this entire match upside down.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [951s - 952s]
Alright.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [952s - 954s]
But he's all over the ring.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [959s - 965s]
Awesome. Ready to roll out of the ring up. After that German Suplexa.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [966s - 974s]
I think it should read up a bit as I mean, it was in a high angle landing across the tops of his shoulders, the base of his When you dealing with over 330 pounds, that much weight crashing down the your body will damage anybody.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [975s - 983s]
And with read out of the equation, at least it allows Omiro and Omiro coming out to buy some time catch their breath a bit, potentially, or this could be an opportunity for both of them to to step on the gas to engage in a one on one competition.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [988s - 994s]
Your odds aren't gonna get any better than they could be right now if you're Americano or Jehoussa.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [995s - 997s]
And you can't count out read here because there are no countouts in this match.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [999s - 1008s]
I'm still, you know, all over the fact that Marocado flew three quarters of the way across the ring and appeared to land face first on the map, and he's still in his bow.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1010s - 1021s]
American now surveying the scene. They finally realizing that Big Bronson Reed is out of the equation for the moment. Jey Husso now coming to the same realization.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1023s - 1024s]
Say, let's throw down while we still have time.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1027s - 1037s]
The official, Rod Zippata, resetting things here is a 10 to two at ringside. Triple threat match continues for an opportunity to get to elevations.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1038s - 1039s]
Chamber.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1044s - 1055s]
The original El Grande Americano attempting to get the WWE Fancy in Atlanta behind him. Yeah. But it's It's it's like a bizarro world for me, Cole. You know, I do triple a on Saturday nights on WWE.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1055s - 1057s]
This coming Saturday this coming

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [1057s - 1057s]
Saturday night.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1058s - 1067s]
Every Saturday night, WWE's YouTube channel. And this original, quote, unquote, El Grande Americano is absolutely south of the border.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1068s - 1070s]
Whereas the other americano is a national hero.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1085s - 1087s]
House and Monday, Americana,

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1091s - 1096s]
Nice German suplex from El Grande. Gonna head up now to the top rope.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1096s - 1098s]
There's a lot of ground to cover.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [1099s - 1102s]
Oh, it's all the way across the wing.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [1102s - 1103s]
Cover.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1103s - 1107s]
Hook in the leg. Reef breaks things up. I don't know if Americano made much at all with Jey Uso and his self.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [1109s - 1110s]
Executed the cover.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1110s - 1116s]
I mean, that could prove to be disastrous. Crashed landed for Americano. Nowhere.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [1117s - 1121s]
Turning me. One sharp and a Suplex into the bridge cover and a kick out at two.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [1123s - 1127s]
The fact that Americano just scrambled his own brains and then pulled this off

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1128s - 1129s]
I champ got against this guy.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1148s - 1150s]
I hate to speculate, obviously, not being medical.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1154s - 1163s]
Quote unquote El Grande Americano is detested south of the border. Whereas the other americano is a national hero.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1163s - 1167s]
Well, well, he is the original one. Corey. He's the first one to appear in this mask and get up.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [1169s - 1170s]
Last summer. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1177s - 1190s]
Yeah. At this now. A grande. A was taken over. James soak in a bit of trouble here. Interested to see what can do inside elimination chamber if that comes to be.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1205s - 1216s]
Ladies and gentlemen, back here on Monday night, while this triple threat match continues for a spot in the elimination chamber. A grande Americano main event, Jey Uso.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1217s - 1221s]
Bronson Reed is also in this match, but moments ago, we see Bronson Reed bulldozing the pile to break up the pinball attempt.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1222s - 1232s]
And immediately looking at his gray arm. I hate to speculate, obviously, not being medical professional, but it could be a bicep. It could be an elbow. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1233s - 1235s]
He pointed toward the bicep, as the the ringside doctor is out here outside the ring.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [1235s - 1236s]
Look out, Cole.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1236s - 1241s]
On And this is to do a one on one matchup between Jey Uso and Americano.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [1242s - 1250s]
An opportunity to get to Chicago to fill the final spot inside the elimination chamber with a spotted WrestleMania on the line.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1253s - 1267s]
Huso throwing caution to the wind. A great effect a moment ago, but there is still work to be done. It's sort of happenstance has gotta be viewed as good luck if you're Jey Uso or El Grande Americano having Bronson neutralized.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1268s - 1277s]
For at least the past several minutes remains to be seen whether or not he'll be able to continue this matchup. But this just means it's a one on one competition for the moment.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1277s - 1283s]
're gonna make big things happen. Yeah. But America icano will not allow it foresee.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [1283s - 1288s]

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [1655s - 1655s]

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [1665s - 1690s]
You know, Corey, it was right here, and it lasted Georgia last summer that started up stepping into care's prize here in WWE won the battle of oil and evolution. She would go out, of course, win the world title, which stood out to be most of all the controversial things that care said last week to inform was the fact that Stephanie feels as though she's walked through hell and made it her own.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1690s - 1697s]
La Primera is eager to take the grandest stage in the mall and prove to the world that nobody can outrest her.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [1697s - 1706s]
And one of the important points that Stephanie made was that she's done it on her own. She hasn't had any support. She had anybody backing her off.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [1706s - 1709s]
She hasn't had to hide behind anybody else like Liv Morgan has.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1711s - 1720s]
Well, the hair came from in Chile. There really isn't in hopes of someday getting an opportunity to Steffy doors of WWE.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [0s - 4s]
Earlier tonight, we saw Jay Uso become the final competitor to qualify for the men's elimination chamber match.

Nick always.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [250s - 254s]

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [342s - 347s]
Accompanied by the Oracle Hayden, long time relationship between these two men.

🎤 SPEAKER_25 [348s - 378s]
Brock, Lesnar, going to stand up and wander away after what this man has done to me in the past and have mercy you as well, Corey.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [384s - 386s]
Thank you again for that night. I get C. Rexed.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [386s - 388s]
I don't believe he can't see me.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [389s - 390s]
He sees everything.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [423s - 432s]
My name is Paul Fayne. Yes. I am an Oracle.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [436s - 442s]
My name? Is Paul But most of all Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [456s - 478s]
History lesson for all of you. Traditionally, WrestleMania had two main events. The title match and the undertaker's streak.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [481s - 483s]
Now, I have to remind you my client, Leicester conquered the undertakers on the Phoenix.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [484s - 485s]
Streak at WrestleMania.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [489s - 493s]
Which means that neither they spot went to block

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [494s - 494s]
Leicester.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [496s - 506s]
The only dead man walking in is the one that comes down the aisle to face

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [507s - 509s]
Brock Lesnar.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [519s - 524s]
Who will fight Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [526s - 527s]
I don't have a prediction.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [529s - 531s]
I don't even have a spoil for you.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [532s - 572s]
Because when Brock, Webster and I walked through that lock room, there wasn't one person that was managed up that I could identify that would step up these are the appearances that Rox Lester is going to make on the road to WrestleMania.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [578s - 579s]
And at any time, any man is willing to go down history.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [584s - 586s]
By taking the absolute worst victimization possible.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [590s - 603s]
At the grandest stage of the law, that all that man has to do is come down that aisle and get up in the face of Brock. Lester.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [606s - 609s]
But I don't think that's going to happen.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [610s - 627s]
I don't think anyone is going to answer Brock Lesnar's open challenge for WrestleMania. Because if you kids that couldn't look, that that locker room Let's be honest.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [627s - 639s]
Can have all the title matches you want The real main event at WrestleMania is whomever's gonna get their ass kicked and conquered.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [639s - 647s]
Versus rock Lesnar.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [649s - 660s]
And there's no one no one in that locker room with the balls to take that ass kicking at WrestleMania.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [668s - 682s]
Well, it's a double edged sword. I mean, you take the open challenge and you can make your career in you can beat Brock Leisure in WrestleMania. But there's the other problem if you to take on Brock Lesnar or WrestleMania, you may not make it out of Las Vegas.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [686s - 696s]
There is no one in their right mind in this locker room or any other locker room who should be crazy enough to step up the beast incarnate, particularly on the grandest stage of the mall.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [696s - 698s]
This is the man who ended the other streak.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [698s - 702s]
Just imagine what he could do to anyone else's career.

🎤 SPEAKER_33 [709s - 717s]
You think you could stand out there and compare resumes with me? What have you ever done? How You have one butterfly balance.

🎤 SPEAKER_33 [717s - 731s]
I changed the entire game. I was the first woman to win the main event in WrestleMania. I was the first woman on the cover of the video game, and it was a lot better than your complete moron of a husband's.

🎤 SPEAKER_33 [732s - 743s]
I have taken this business to heights that you have and will not ever reach, even just I have taken it and made it the most talked about.

🎤 SPEAKER_33 [747s - 753s]
All of WWE.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [754s - 756s]
You do not deserve to hold this, but I deserve to get rid of you.

🎤 SPEAKER_33 [759s - 770s]
And retire you in front of all. Of your friends and family in your hometown of Chicago. You'll still be the least talented AJ to retire this

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [771s - 772s]
You're looking for me.

🎤 SPEAKER_33 [772s - 778s]
I'll still be the greatest female wrestler of all time if it's not just me saying, Other people are saying it. Everybody's saying it.

🎤 SPEAKER_33 [778s - 786s]
Sports Illustrated is saying it. The bleacher report is saying it. Saturday, an elimination chamber. I prove it.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [791s - 811s]
Eight believe will have the home field advantage in her hometown of Illinois. If she looks to win, the Intercontinental championship. AJ's first one on one match in a decade first title match in eleven years, and she has to dock off one of the all time brakes in Becky Lynch to win the gold.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [930s - 933s]
Chamber match. This coming Saturday.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [939s - 940s]
In that match.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [944s - 952s]
Comes to Javan. Then sometimes what you don't know can benefit you. Evan's the youngest superstar in the elimination chamber.

🎤 SPEAKER_26 [952s - 965s]
Least experienced of the field. And the yellow Jeep repeats like he's playing without wasn't even four.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [993s - 994s]
Everyone's gotta tell.

🎤 SPEAKER_31 [997s - 998s]
Blink.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [1000s - 1001s]
A breath.
