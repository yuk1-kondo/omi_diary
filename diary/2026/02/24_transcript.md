Who It does.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [225s - 225s]

👤 あなた [225s - 230s]
Anyways, have a good day. Let me know. Let let me know how your appraisal goes,

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [230s - 230s]
Rachel.

👤 あなた [232s - 233s]
But I You're not.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [234s - 242s]
But If you cannot compare, me and interrupting because I want to tell you that I'm thirsty to there's a door wide open. I'm sorry. That little door needs to be showing.

👤 あなた [242s - 251s]
Yes. I know it's open. I was, like, about to explain to you why it was open. You just heard me that you never open front door, come up, says, grab someone, go back down with them.

👤 あなた [252s - 256s]
Honey. And the door, which you didn't even see I see. Was No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [256s - 257s]
You were you were there.

👤 あなた [258s - 260s]
Yeah. I was here. You never walked out and looked.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [260s - 264s]
Well, no. Did because then I followed you and I saw how far why it was open.

👤 あなた [264s - 266s]
It wasn't even far wide open.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [266s - 297s]
It was wasn't completely open like that, but it was to come say, honey, I I I I I I I understand that you don't wanna be talking to me, and I'm working on that. But that situation is complete it's two completely different things. Now obviously, if you perceive that there's no risk to door be open, you're gonna think it was a point that's interruption and not fair. I clearly perceive that risk to be way higher than you do, but that's always been the case. You've never had a problem with things being on. I'm saying, don't think that door wrote for why she used it. Because my handbag's hanging up. You're like, well, it's fine. You're always gonna take your handbag.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [298s - 304s]
So we clearly we had a different perceived risk of the situation. Just why I was cheating it with more urgency than you were.

👤 あなた [306s - 307s]
Do Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [307s - 308s]
You do wanna get into it, do you?

👤 あなた [312s - 315s]
I've already I've I've already explained to you that understand why you did it, Rachel.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [323s - 323s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [323s - 326s]
But you can't link it in with every character flaw.

👤 あなた [327s - 328s]
Every time I So every character flaw is yours.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [329s - 339s]
Because I can go all by the way meet you who would is really important, and that's not that important. You cannot combine it with that. Maybe that's that's two completely different things.

👤 あなた [344s - 345s]
Let's have look here, dude.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [22s - 29s]
Just just a quick just a quick follow-up, Stefan, if I can. That was very interesting. Because, obviously, we're talking about the the right of the the apostles to reinterpret.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [30s - 54s]
Supposedly scripture in a way that we cannot cannot reproduce. But connected to that, I'm wondering about are they also modeling how scripture is meant to be read to us and thus in some ways, scripture is meant to be accessible to to fishermen, as well as Leonard. But on saying that, fishermen, as you've already pointed out, would have known the Psalms really well and possibly more so. We don't have that today.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [55s - 85s]
So in a sense of modeling how we read scripture or even as preachers how we you know, approach scripture in this way. Are we are they are the apostles modeling for us then a way which we're meant to be reading scripture and thus right. So in that sense, it isn't just kind of something we can't reproduce. In fact, we we should be doing so, but on on the foundation of of good knowledge of of the of the Old Testament particularly as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [4s - 19s]
So I go to a church in Japan, and last week after the they handed out these papers, and they had a meeting. And it's basically a financial breakdown of absolutely all the money that has come in to the church down to the yen, so down to the cent. It says how much money they had left over from events.

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [19s - 28s]
And then on the other side, it has everywhere that they spent money, And, again, it's down to the very end, so you know where absolutely all the money is going.

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [28s - 43s]
It's super transparent. It's super honest. I think it's great. It's it's a good safeguard against any kind of corruption it's good beneficial for people to know where the money is going when they're giving. Yeah. I'm curious. What country are you in?

🎤 SPEAKER_22 [43s - 54s]
Does your church have something like this? Do you think it's a good idea? Do you think more churches should be doing this, or do you think it's none of nobody's ease wax where my goes and they should just be happy giving?

So I'll watch those videos in advance and then we can you know, have a more kind of informed chat about it I guess. In answer to the the short, I'm all for financial, you know, what's the word I'm looking for? Transparency, that's the word.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [120s - 148s]
My only thoughts are is that we'd want to you know, be careful about it in the sense that how we present it in terms of where an elder led church or we're certainly going to be. And so we want to be open and transparent about how we spend the money. But equally not invite too much input into people's opinions on that unless it was unless it was, you know,

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [154s - 180s]
Hey Ben, thank you for sending those through. Yes, lunch on Thursday sounds good. I can't remember whose turn it is to bring lunch. I'm happy to do so. If it's if if that works. And I'll watch the the finance videos that you put together. I haven't yet. I did plan to watch them Friday, but I had to bump them along I'm But I'll do that in advance of Thursday. So we can, have an informed chat about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [182s - 193s]
So that's I believe that's 12:12 o'clock, isn't it? Regarding that short, I I'm really for the principle of transparency. Oops. Shown's at the door. One sec.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [202s - 202s]
Hello, mate.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [204s - 205s]
Cheers, man. Thank you, mate.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [213s - 230s]
Yeah. Sorry about that. Delivery man. Yeah. I'm all for transparency. I'm very happy to do that. And I think something that I've I've wanted to do, and we have done actually in the past when Andy was here, was produce some sort of reports that broke down the the, you know, how we spent the money.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [232s - 243s]
Tied in with kind of like an annual kind of presentation of the church as finances and maybe a bit of vision casting, if I can use that word for the for the coming year.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [245s - 277s]
So we kind of pray about it as a leadership and think about how we wanna spend the money how we what we have vision for and faith for and then any shortfall we present to the church and at that point then they also receive a report from the previous year. My only questions I guess about how we do this is we want to be transparent but in we are an elder led church as opposed to a kind of more of a Baptist member model kind of church. So in that sense, accountability is important.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [281s - 292s]
How we invite that accountability and who we're accountable to is also important. So what am I trying to say there?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [296s - 315s]
I guess I want to share with the church how we spend the money so they can be informed in their prayers and things like that. But not necessarily invite opinion on how we are to spend the money. That is a leadership decision, I guess. So maybe we can think about how we do that presentationally.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [315s - 331s]
But, I'm all for I'm all for accountability. I'll I'll also probably want to because that's quite an important matter to get right, maybe chat with some of the mentors about it. I'll advance churches approach financial transparency.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [332s - 339s]
And maybe we can then have a chat about it. Anyway, mate. Hope that makes sense. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday midday.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [339s - 343s]
And I can bring lunches. Cheers, man.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [343s - 343s]

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [348s - 372s]

I did plan to watch them Friday, but I had to bump them along, I'm afraid. But I'll do that in advance of Thursday so we can, have an informed chat about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [374s - 376s]
So that's I believe that's 12:12 o'clock, isn't it?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [380s - 388s]
Regarding that short I I'm really for the principle of transparency. Oops. I was at the door. One sec. Yeah. Sorry about that. Delivery man.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [449s - 450s]
Thank you very much. You too.

👤 あなた [469s - 483s]
My only, questions, I guess, about how we do this is want to be transparent, but in we are an outlet church as opposed to a kind of moral of practice member model kind of church.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [483s - 486s]
So in that sense, accountability is important, but how we invite that accountability and who we're comfortable too is also important.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [497s - 501s]
So so what am I trying to say? There?

🎤 SPEAKER_23 [504s - 508s]
I guess I want to share with the church how we spend the money so they can be informed in their prayers and things like that.

🎤 SPEAKER_23 [508s - 547s]
But not necessarily invite invites opinion on how we are to spend them in. That is a leadership decision, I guess. Guess. So maybe we can think about how how we do that presentationally. But, yeah, I think I'm all for accountability. I'll also want to because it's quite an important matter to get right, maybe chat with some of the mentors about it, might have power over our advantage to approach financial transparency, and maybe we can then have a chat it. Anyway, mate, hope that makes sense. I'll look forward to seeing you after Thursday midday, and I'll bring lunches.
