🎤 SPEAKER_3 [224s - 224s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [224s - 225s]
Who It does.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [225s - 225s]
Right.

👤 あなた [225s - 230s]
Anyways, have a good day. Let me know. Let let me know how your appraisal goes,

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [230s - 230s]
Rachel.

👤 あなた [232s - 233s]
But I You're not.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [234s - 242s]
But If you cannot compare, me and interrupting because I want to tell you that I'm thirsty to there's a door wide open. I'm sorry. That little door needs to be showing.

👤 あなた [242s - 251s]
Yes. I know it's open. I was, like, about to explain to you why it was open. You just heard me that you never open front door, come up, says, grab someone, go back down with them.

👤 あなた [252s - 256s]
Honey. And the door, which you didn't even see I see. Was No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [256s - 257s]
You were you were there.

👤 あなた [258s - 260s]
Yeah. I was here. You never walked out and looked.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [260s - 264s]
Well, no. Did because then I followed you and I saw how far why it was open.

👤 あなた [264s - 266s]
It wasn't even far wide open.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [266s - 297s]
It was wasn't completely open like that, but it was to come say, honey, I I I I I I I understand that you don't wanna be talking to me, and I'm working on that. But that situation is complete it's two completely different things. Now obviously, if you perceive that there's no risk to door be open, you're gonna think it was a point that's interruption and not fair. I clearly perceive that risk to be way higher than you do, but that's always been the case. You've never had a problem with things being on. I'm saying, don't think that door wrote for why she used it. Because my handbag's hanging up. You're like, well, it's fine. You're always gonna take your handbag.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [298s - 304s]
So we clearly we had a different perceived risk of the situation. Just why I was cheating it with more urgency than you were.

👤 あなた [306s - 307s]
Do Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [307s - 308s]
You do wanna get into it, do you?

Omi, what's the version?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [311s - 312s]
Was urgent.

👤 あなた [312s - 315s]
I've already I've I've already explained to you that understand why you did it, Rachel.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [323s - 323s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [323s - 326s]
But you can't link it in with every character flaw.

👤 あなた [327s - 328s]
Every time I So every character flaw is yours.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [329s - 339s]
Because I can go all by the way meet you who would is really important, and that's not that important. You cannot combine it with that. Maybe that's that's two completely different things.

👤 あなた [344s - 345s]
Let's have look here, dude.

This morning. I think I was just gonna completely unhappy about that this morning. I think I was just completely completely Was enough time.

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [20s - 29s]
Running upstairs, grabbing something or running back down is very different to coming upstairs, putting something down, saying, oh, by the way, John is gonna come through this.

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [30s - 34s]
And all I said was, can we just is the door wide open? Can we just, like, either

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [58s - 81s]
you need to go for a time and shut I I just this should I just think it's completely unfair. It's a totally different scenario to anything else. Just need to do, like, and this and this, and you would completely refuse that. Like, I'm just saying that I'm not happy with the door being open.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [83s - 95s]
I just like, my my bags are right there. I can't I mean, it's fine until it's not fine, until someone happens to be wiggled. You know, if you were opposite us, come on.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [95s - 106s]
On. There's a criminal activity there. All it takes is every person to have them to come. Like, it doesn't hurt. Just have to door shut on our house with all our possessions. And all I'm asking is can we just carry this on with that?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [107s - 114s]
I'm not saying can we stop? Can we stop talking? Can you do anything? I'm just wanting to keep an eye on the door. He's only doing massive wow.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [115s - 141s]
Just think that's so unfair now because two, like, that's not fair. And now I've got my blinking appraisal, and I just even feel in the mood for it at all. And I'm cross about it because you go on jump on, and you'll probably come back now and go, well, well, Rachel, we've got an issue with this because you keep interrupting me. But I'm telling you that I'm sorry I was not happy that the front door was open. So I don't care whether I in chatting you. I do it a 100 times over.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [142s - 161s]
And you say, oh, it was only gonna be ten seconds. What? You got up there long enough that I fell on uncomfortable with how long the doors open. So you can either say what tough you have to feel on uncomfortable, or you could just accept, like, offline, which is a bit much on this. I think the past is fine. But you didn't have to jump in and just get really angry with me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [161s - 170s]
Me, refuse to talk to me. I'm not that's it. I'm not telling you anything that. But but but you've done this is a problem with you. This is this. This is this. I come on.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [171s - 180s]
I just think that was really unfair. Now I'm unhappy because has just woke up till I was arguing. And I just don't think that's fair at all, so I'm not happy.
