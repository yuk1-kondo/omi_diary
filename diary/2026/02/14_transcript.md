Well, he's obviously seen as a better option on the bench than say, who else would be Exactly. No. That's true.

👤 あなた [432s - 450s]
You like King? So what interesting the BBM went for deploying another normal midfielder to replace Windsor rather than put chambers in there because we've got an abundance of defending on the bench, but we've only got one in coming back from injury midfield So I think he's probably acknowledging that it's highly likely that we're gonna need to play a lift more effectively, but not straight away.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [453s - 461s]
I think think they're not, like, they're not really, like, league one side. They play, like, a league one side.
