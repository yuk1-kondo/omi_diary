### 💬 Family Morning Chat and Getting Ready for School

**時間**: 18:21  
**カテゴリ**: family
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-d4b33d7d)

The recording captures a casual family morning at home. One adult (likely the user’s partner) gently critiques the user’s oversized jumper, explaining that it hangs in a way that makes the user look larger and that true oversized jumpers are cut differently and suit very slim people or particular body types. They compare styles humorously to Lionel Richie and discuss winter vs. spring clothing.

The scene then shifts to managing children and screens: a child (Elliot) is told to turn off a game and is reminded that the progress will save, while another adult notes a game hasn’t been used since October. There’s some light admonishing about starting a new game and negotiations about coming off devices and getting changed.

Outside or near a window, the adults talk about a very wet, poorly pitched area of ground where water collects; one suggests building up the soil slightly so it slopes and drains better. They reference nearby plots, brambles, and possibly neighboring properties or burial plots while trying to locate something in the distance at night.

Back inside, preparations for the day continue: they discuss Jude’s upcoming time in goal and advise him to wear a baseball cap if facing the sun so he can see the ball, and ask to turn down the volume because it’s too loud. They briefly talk about apple tart and hot drinks, including whether to leave a tea or coffee bag in, and how to drink from a lidded cup safely.

As they get ready to leave, one adult lists tasks waiting for them later, including finishing sermons and sending early‑week questions to someone named Paul Spear so he has time to respond. The user then insists on locking Jude’s screen so they won’t be late for football/school, wrapping up the bustling, slightly hectic family routine.

**📋 アクションアイテム**:
- [ ] Get Elliot early on Monday
- [ ] Finish sermons
- [ ] Send interview questions to Paul Spear early in the week

### 👥 Friends Chat About Golf And Stargazing

**時間**: 18:54  
**カテゴリ**: social
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-13bca587)

The conversation is a casual morning chat between the user and someone named Exactly. They talk about the wet weather, which has caused the local golf course to close due to flooding and concerns about damaging the turf. Exactly mentions having only played golf twice since November because of the rain. The user then talks enthusiastically about a proper telescope they received, which can see planets. They describe having briefly viewed Jupiter and three of its moons from their garden, but continued cloud cover has largely prevented further use. They also reference a one‑hour viewing window at the Cardiff museum area, near the old RAF base. No concrete plans or commitments are made; it’s mainly sharing updates and frustrations about weather affecting their hobbies.

### ⚽ Post-Match Chat on Goalkeeping and Injury

**時間**: 19:55

The conversation captures a brief post-match discussion between the user and a player (Omi) about a knock to the player's leg during a football game. The user checks on the injury, noting numbness around the leg/foot and explaining it was a solid impact. They reassure the player that if the pain gets worse later, medicine can be taken, but emphasize there is still a party to enjoy afterwards. The user contextualizes the injury as a normal part of goalkeeping, where many knocks are expected, and frames this as a learning experience. They praise the player for reacting quickly, making good saves, and handling fast shots, particularly in the first half, and compliment the overall performance in the second game.

### 💬 Parent and Jude Discuss Social Media and Safety

**時間**: 20:05

**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-7d04a74f)

A parent and Jude talk through plans for a long birthday party that overlaps with watching a Cardiff football match, agreeing that Jude will likely miss the game but have more fun at the party. The parent then explains why social media (Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Messenger) is unhealthy and potentially harmful for children, noting that it may soon be banned for under‑16s and that many parents ignore age rules. They distinguish YouTube from social media, and outline strict conditions if Jude is allowed WhatsApp: no group chats and regular checks of his phone and conversations, emphasizing online safety and Jude’s tendency to break rules compared to Elliot, who is described as a rule‑follower. The parent also stresses the importance of sufficient sleep for children and adults, promising that Jude will one day appreciate limits on screens and social media. Later, they chat about the weather, Jude’s performance as a goalkeeper, and how even professional keepers make mistakes. Jude has suffered a knock to the leg; they examine the bruise, talk through how it happened, and consider ice and whether he can still play. Back at home, they manage beads spilled from Jude’s boots at the doorstep, mention a dead fish in the tank, replace batteries in a toy, and troubleshoot getting the Xbox/Chromecast working, using this as a moment to teach Jude patience. Overall, the interaction is a mix of everyday family logistics, reassurance, and firm guidance on safety and digital habits.

### ⚽ Friends Recount Dramatic Youth Football Match

**時間**: 21:02  
**カテゴリ**: sports
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-38ef00ce)

The user and a friend (Exactly) chat about a recent, very tense youth football cup match where Santi scored a third goal to make it 3–3, with kids celebrating wildly in the corner. They note it’s been a while since they enjoyed a game like that and mention having previously gone out in the first round against Cogan. They discuss the cup being more exciting than league play and consider which teams are strongest, focusing on Barry Athletic and their hilltop pitch at Penarth, which stays playable despite mud. The friend describes how muddy and sloped the pitch was, comparing it to playing on the side of Snowdon, and recounts a controversial penalty incident from Dave’s team, where Zach gave away a penalty that some thought should have been a red card. The friend explains they missed the ball because their foot got stuck in the mud while trying to clear it.

### 💬 Family Chat About Football And Haircuts

**時間**: 22:41  
**カテゴリ**: family
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-e7736c6f)

The conversation mixes casual family chat with football talk and a haircut. They briefly recall where a mattress was bought, then focus on their football club’s promotion prospects, comparing their position to Lincoln and other teams. They discuss points ahead of third place, recent form, goals conceded, and how many wins are needed to secure the league, mentioning a small £2 bet that would return £32 if they win the title. Toward the end, they prepare for Elliot’s haircut, debating how to describe it to the barber (mid taper, number on back and sides, short on top) and clarifying that clipper guard numbers only apply to sides/back, not scissor-cut hair on top.

### 🎬 Friends Discuss Football Management Mobile Game

**時間**: 22:50  
**カテゴリ**: entertainment
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-b1622e61)

The user and a friend chat informally about a football management-style mobile game (accessed via Netflix), where the player acts as the club chairman rather than the manager. They mention divisions (Division 1 and 2), rating systems, a 65-rated attacker, promotion history from non-league in 2026 up to League Two, and features like stadium expansion and adding food options. The rest of the dialogue is casual side comments about the tight space and recording device.
