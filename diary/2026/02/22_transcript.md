🎤 SPEAKER_2 [120s - 124s]
Divorce or something. And she continued going there.

👤 あなた [126s - 127s]
And Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [127s - 140s]
He hasn't been in church He's started another lady Yes. Who's moved over here, and so they've started coming Right. In October. Sounds like he's Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [142s - 143s]
Struggled.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [146s - 147s]
Don't know. So, I mean, that's kinda Yeah.

👤 あなた [148s - 161s]
Well, I can tell you is that I would just be very, very careful with because he was a trustee for us for a while. He's a he's a seemingly a good guy. But we had there was a couple of police call outs and there's domestic violence.

👤 あなた [163s - 180s]
Ultimately, there's kind of an abusive situation going on there. We tried to bring some reconciliation. The situation was the Joe decided to kind of his his ex wife, well, they're not divorced yet, be clear.

👤 あなた [180s - 191s]
Tim is Tim is I would I'm not a psychologist, but I would probably describe him as kind of a textbook, kind of kind of, yes, probably diagnosable narcissism.

👤 あなた [193s - 235s]
If I can put it that way. He he he didn't want to so Joe wanted to kind of separate with the view of restoration. But that point Tim was completely completely out. He was nope. And he blamed the church, basically. He blamed us for the for divorce, but the separation. But that was never we never ever said they should divorce. That's not my view at all. This restaurant oration always when when when possible. But he so he but he there's been quite a few police involvements and some very concerning stuff we had to report to social services regarding his behavior. But he's got a lot of charm, you see. So he comes across very well. But privately, he's very aggressive and abusive So I'll just be I'll just be careful there.

👤 あなた [236s - 247s]
On that basis. He wouldn't engage with me the moment basically, the moment Joe decided to leave him with the view to restoration, he never once wanted to meet and talk about it. He just blamed us.

👤 あなた [248s - 264s]
For for ending his marriage, but he he wasn't acknowledging basically his his his behavior in it. So that's that's the short version. The the long version is he he won't he won't go ahead with the divorce because he there's some sort of many many element to it.

👤 あなた [266s - 278s]
So so but but to be honest with you, Tim was still a trustee with us for whilst this all happened. So he he's not had a conversation with me since then. From what I gather, he blames he blames us.

👤 あなた [279s - 286s]
But that's not the case. If you would have met with me, told him the case that we've never ever recommend divorce and we want to see this marriage restored.
