Divorce or something. And she continued going there.

👤 あなた [126s - 127s]
And Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [127s - 140s]
He hasn't been in church He's started another lady Yes. Who's moved over here, and so they've started coming Right. In October. Sounds like he's Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [142s - 143s]
Struggled.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [146s - 147s]
Don't know. So, I mean, that's kinda Yeah.

👤 あなた [148s - 161s]
Well, I can tell you is that I would just be very, very careful with because he was a trustee for us for a while. He's a he's a seemingly a good guy. But we had there was a couple of police call outs and there's domestic violence.

👤 あなた [163s - 180s]
Ultimately, there's kind of an abusive situation going on there. We tried to bring some reconciliation. The situation was the Joe decided to kind of his his ex wife, well, they're not divorced yet, be clear.

👤 あなた [180s - 191s]
Tim is Tim is I would I'm not a psychologist, but I would probably describe him as kind of a textbook, kind of kind of, yes, probably diagnosable narcissism.

👤 あなた [193s - 235s]
If I can put it that way. He he he didn't want to so Joe wanted to kind of separate with the view of restoration. But that point Tim was completely completely out. He was nope. And he blamed the church, basically. He blamed us for the for divorce, but the separation. But that was never we never ever said they should divorce. That's not my view at all. This restaurant oration always when when when possible. But he so he but he there's been quite a few police involvements and some very concerning stuff we had to report to social services regarding his behavior. But he's got a lot of charm, you see. So he comes across very well. But privately, he's very aggressive and abusive So I'll just be I'll just be careful there.

👤 あなた [236s - 247s]
On that basis. He wouldn't engage with me the moment basically, the moment Joe decided to leave him with the view to restoration, he never once wanted to meet and talk about it. He just blamed us.

👤 あなた [248s - 264s]
For for ending his marriage, but he he wasn't acknowledging basically his his his behavior in it. So that's that's the short version. The the long version is he he won't he won't go ahead with the divorce because he there's some sort of many many element to it.

👤 あなた [266s - 278s]
So so but but to be honest with you, Tim was still a trustee with us for whilst this all happened. So he he's not had a conversation with me since then. From what I gather, he blames he blames us.

👤 あなた [279s - 286s]
But that's not the case. If you would have met with me, told him the case that we've never ever recommend divorce and we want to see this marriage restored.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [651s - 656s]
Let's do. Yeah. That

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [660s - 665s]
Okay. Good.

👤 あなた [666s - 676s]
Let's find you like I'm out. Is it loud? It feels a bit silly way in one of these in a small room, but it's it's it's for the supposedly for the quality of the recording of the audio.

👤 あなた [677s - 678s]
I'll bear with it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [678s - 694s]
Let's pray. Yeah. Father, we just thank you for this We just thank you that all of the dedication and the hard work that you present prepared in your word, we the pray this morning that it will come into our hearts into our minds as we take it away today.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [694s - 699s]
That we can use it this week. Our walk with you in Jesus' name. Amen.

👤 あなた [700s - 707s]
Amen. Thank you, John. Thank you. That is a bit loud. Can Omi, let me just turn it down before we get started. Yeah. Please. You on it? Oh, good.

👤 あなた [708s - 709s]
A real sound person.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [709s - 710s]
Good.

👤 あなた [711s - 730s]
Well, simple Christian catechism part two. So so those of you who've joined us since we started part one, we did a big series Well, I say I think it was bigger. I think it was significant last March where we talked about the importance of getting to know our really well.

👤 あなた [731s - 755s]
Because we want to guard a good deposit interested to us so we can pass it on faithfully to the generation if you like. We wanna guard ourselves from error. We use the we use the analogy of how a bank someone working in the bank can tell a fake fake note is to get to know the real notes really well. And that's what we're trying to do. We're getting to know our really well so that we can communicate it faithfully and we can spot for teachers easily.

👤 あなた [756s - 769s]
More well, more easily. And so part one, I did a recap on that last week. We are about to launch a new podcast player kind of thing, which is quite exciting. Jonathan's been working on it.

👤 あなた [770s - 783s]
And so you can listen to all the talks. You can sort it by series, by preach, you can favorite some. You can download them to listen to them on your phone if you prefer. And so we've got a few a bit of a backlog we're gonna upload on there.

👤 あなた [784s - 797s]
And last week, I covered part one one, part two now. I'm really excited about it. What kind of redeemer do we need? The question and answers already been revealed to you. So the punchline of the sermon is kind of there.

👤 あなた [797s - 804s]
So I was thinking, well, how can I how can I kind of word this in a way that you don't think you've already got the you have in a way?

👤 あなた [805s - 822s]
But let me ask you something, a few questions. Why does it matter who Jesus is? If Jesus were not exactly who scripture says he is, would the cross still save you?

👤 あなた [822s - 834s]
Have you ever thought about that? If Jesus was slightly different, would you still be saved? It's not a small question. It's a and it's not a theological hobby question either.

👤 あなた [835s - 853s]
It's a question about salvation. Really important question to consider. We often talk about what Jesus did. We talked about how he died, how he rose, again, how he forgives us, how he saves. But what if the most important thing about salvation is not what happened on the cross?

👤 あなた [855s - 867s]
But who was hanging on the cross. Or to put it another way, if anyone else was on the cross in our place, would it still be effective?

👤 あなた [869s - 878s]
I think that the obvious answer is no. Rachel and I are flying to, as Johnny said, we're flying to Cape Town in a few weeks time.

👤 あなた [879s - 895s]
For the advance global conference. We are going through the generosity of once again of Mark Harbor Church Stephen Jack. He's he's been a great support of ours and he said you gotta get there. And I said, we're a small church plant. We can't we'll use up half the church budget just to fly us there.

👤 あなた [895s - 901s]
And he said, no. We've got Advance has got money for this sort of thing. We've got some. We'll we'll pay for the flights. We'll pay for the accommodation.

👤 あなた [901s - 918s]
Make sure you're there. So we're and we're going. It's a long flight. Steven, Steven, Rana, Obviously, we've got a are you from Cape Town? Are you from No. Johannesburg. Right. So we've got a we've got a South African here anyway. So it's a long flight. It's over oceans. It's over the whole of Africa.

👤 あなた [923s - 951s]
Yeah. Have you has anyone here seen the movie catch me if you can? With Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks? A wonderful movie. It's for those of you who don't know about it, is Leo the based loosely, it turns out, on a true story about a con artist a world class con artist who managed to fake number of professions. He he managed to pretend to be a surgeon and got himself a job in a in a really high prestigious hospital. He he pretended to be a lawyer.

👤 あなた [952s - 960s]
And he also pretended to be a commercial airplane pilot. And the film is all about the FBI chasing after this guy, trying to catch him.

👤 あなた [961s - 974s]
He was he sat off in bank bank for a he kind of did that. He never flew a plane, thankfully. But a pilot, you get to you get to have free flights, and that's kinda why he used it. He kind got to pretend that he's a pilot so he could fly places for free.

👤 あなた [975s - 1001s]
But imagine if he did manage to get onto the control of the of the plane. Yeah. Next week, a few weeks time, Rachel and I are trusting something. We're trusting something. I'm trusting that the pilot that's fly flying the BA plane is qualified and is not a fraud. Right? That's what I'm trusting. I'm trusting that's the case.

👤 あなた [1002s - 1013s]
I'm trusting then the pilot is who he says he is. I'm trusting that he is really is trained. He is authorized. He's a competent airline pilot, and I'm sure he is.

👤 あなた [1013s - 1023s]
Because once that plane takes off, I'm not in control of that plane. I used to when I used to fly, I used to hold this the armrest trying to keep the plane steady, which is obviously really silly.

👤 あなた [1023s - 1034s]
When I was younger. But my safety then doesn't depend on how sincere I think this pile is about his credentials. It depends entirely on who is flying the plane. Right?

👤 あなた [1035s - 1050s]
If the pilot is slightly unqualified, all of us on that plane well, we're we're in serious trouble, aren't we? He looks the parts, but is not fully trained, then we're not safe. We're not safe.

👤 あなた [1051s - 1067s]
He talks confidently, but he doesn't have the credentials, we're not landing probably very well. And so the success success of our flight depends not on what the plane does, but who's flying it. That's the point. And this is this is the point that I wanna make. This is the thing that why this matters. Okay?

👤 あなた [1073s - 1089s]
Identity determines the outcome. In the same way, Christianity doesn't simply say, look at what Jesus did. That's not the end of Christianity. It's it's look at who Jesus is.

👤 あなた [1090s - 1107s]
Look at who Jesus is, And so, the apostle John knew this. The early church faced people who talked about Jesus a lot and who Jesus was. And that was that was the big kind of discussion for the first five hundred years of the church. Who is Jesus?

👤 あなた [1110s - 1122s]
People talk about him all the time. They use his name. They they quote it as words, but some some of the Gnostic church, they reshape it, they reduced him, they adjusted him. So John wrote these words. It quite led into his life, the apostle John. He wrote this.

👤 あなた [1122s - 1133s]
Let's in fact, let's read it together. If you've got a bible, we're reading from one John four near the end of the bible. You've got one John, two John, three John.

👤 あなた [1137s - 1145s]
Jude, Revelation, We've got one so one John chapter four. And if you're reading from the Pew Bible, do the usual chat if you're there first.

👤 あなた [1147s - 1154s]
Congratulations. I was gonna say. You win. One I won't even listen. +1 227. +1 227.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1154s - 1155s]
Here we are.

👤 あなた [1156s - 1165s]
It will be on the screen, but I want us to get used to being familiar with our paper bible. See? One John four.

👤 あなた [1170s - 1173s]
Oh, that is tiny text, it? Can you read that?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1173s - 1174s]
Yeah. Yes.

👤 あなた [1174s - 1180s]
Yeah. Okay. Good. No. Okay. I'll don't worry. I will then I'll read out for us. K.

👤 あなた [1183s - 1198s]
Dear friends, do not believe every spirit. But test the spirits to see whether they are from God. Because many false prophets have gone out into the world, This is how you can recognize the spirit of god.

👤 あなた [1199s - 1209s]
Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. But every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus not from god.

👤 あなた [1212s - 1226s]
This is the spirit of the antichrist, you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. There's lots you could do quite a few summons on that passage alone, But now notice what John does not say.

👤 あなた [1227s - 1236s]
He does not say test the spirits whether they talk about love. He does not say test whether they are kind, these preachers are kind.

👤 あなた [1237s - 1241s]
These spirits are kind. What does he tell believers to test?

👤 あなた [1244s - 1259s]
He says, test what they say about Jesus. Test what they say about Because if you get Jesus wrong, you get everything wrong. If you get Jesus wrong, you get everything wrong.

👤 あなた [1260s - 1274s]
And so what we're talking about today then isn't about learning some theological trivia. This is really important for us ourselves, but also in how we communicate this to others and how we pass this truth onto our children.

👤 あなた [1275s - 1289s]
And anybody that we have influence on. Is this really important? Because if Jesus is not fully and completely who scriptures say he is, the cross does not save you.

👤 あなた [1290s - 1298s]
If we understand Jesus even slightly differently to the way the bible reveals reveals him to be, then we are trusted in someone else and not the real Jesus.

👤 あなた [1299s - 1309s]
And that's why the church has always guarded this doctrine fiercely, and it was fierce, fierce battle over the years, over the centuries.

👤 あなた [1311s - 1323s]
And here's the truth at the center of everything we are, everything we are about to see. Okay? This this next slide I hope I got on a slide. If you remember this, then you've got the whole thing.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1323s - 1323s]
Okay?

👤 あなた [1324s - 1337s]
No, I didn't have a slide. Oh, that's a shame. Can write it down if you want. Oh, why I put slide this one? Okay. Our salvation our salvation depends on who Jesus is.

👤 あなた [1338s - 1355s]
On who Jesus is not just what Jesus did. It's both. Our salvation depends on who Jesus is, not just what Jesus did. Everything on that truth. Everything hangs on that. Let's see why.

👤 あなた [1356s - 1368s]
If you get this wrong. Okay. Forget him wrong. John says something astonishing. Doesn't He says, do not believe every spirit. In other words, not every voice that uses the name of Jesus speaks the truth about Jesus.

👤 あなた [1370s - 1378s]
That means it's possible to talk about Christ and yet be wrong about Christ. It's possible to use his name and also not know him.

👤 あなた [1379s - 1391s]
It's possible to preach Jesus. And preach a different savior. So John says test it. Not just the spirits, but those who speak about Christ.

👤 あなた [1391s - 1404s]
Through those spirits. Test what? Don't test the tone. Don't test the style or the passion. You can have a really passionate, a charismatic preacher. Test what they say.

👤 あなた [1405s - 1415s]
Test what is confessed about Christ. The most important thing. What are they saying about Jesus? Because if you get Jesus wrong, you're not just slightly mistaken.

👤 あなた [1416s - 1419s]
You're trusting in someone who cannot save you.

👤 あなた [1422s - 1431s]
If the parlour is not truly qualified, it doesn't matter how calm he sounds. If Jesus is not who scripture says he is, the cross does not save.

👤 あなた [1432s - 1445s]
A wrong Jesus cannot save you. A slightly altered Jesus cannot reconcile you. Reshaped Jesus cannot bring you to god. Only the real Christ can. And the early church, they understood this.

👤 あなた [1446s - 1453s]
They they understood this really well, and they pretended they protected it fear They guarded it carefully. That's why they wrote the creeds.

👤 あなた [1453s - 1476s]
That's why they wrote the creeds. That's why the first Sunday of each month, we say together the Nicene Creed. We want to place ourselves in the historic Christian faith We don't want to reinvent our faith for ourselves. We want to ensure that we are within historic Christianity guarded, defended, and thought about and articulated on for thousands of years.

👤 あなた [1478s - 1496s]
That's why the early church was willing to exile those who who disagreed with this. That's why the the church was opposing and suddenly even even killing those who preached a different gospel, not saying we should do that, we should defend the faith.

👤 あなた [1497s - 1512s]
Rather than compromise on who Christ is. The who Jesus is is essential. Because they knew something that we often forget. Christianity is not built on admiration of Jesus.

👤 あなた [1513s - 1518s]
It's built on the identity of Jesus. Who Jesus is.

👤 あなた [1522s - 1536s]
Here is a picture of the well known atheist Richard Dawkins. He's a new atheist, self designated new atheist, which was a movement which, thankfully, has peaked in popularity. Was really popular about fifteen years ago.

👤 あなた [1537s - 1549s]
New atheism as opposed to normal atheism, if I can put it that way, is that it's the kind of atheism that doesn't just believe, don't believe in god, They go further than that, and they think the idea of a god is dangerous and should be destroyed.

👤 あなた [1550s - 1559s]
And eliminated because it brings so much harm to the world. So they're kind of that much further. And then here we are. We have Richard Dawkins. We're in atheist for Jesus t shirts.

👤 あなた [1563s - 1571s]
He kind of liked some of the stuff that Jesus said. All that spiritual nonsense he was deluded on, but he had some good nice things to say about how we should live.

👤 あなた [1572s - 1584s]
Is Dawkins view. And Elon Musk this week, I heard him say something like, I agree with the teachings of Jesus. He he tweeted that, not tweeted x. Tweeted out. He he tweeted out, I agree with the teachings of Jesus.

👤 あなた [1585s - 1595s]
Notice that he didn't say, I affirm the identity of Jesus. As the son of God, I submit my life to Jesus. Christianity is not built on the admiration of Jesus.

👤 あなた [1596s - 1605s]
Or even his wonderful teachings. It's built on the identity of Jesus, recognizing that he is the second person of the trinity. He is the lord of your life, and we are to submit to him.

👤 あなた [1607s - 1616s]
Following Jesus' moral teachings by themselves, saves no one. Saves no one. Make the world a better place for sure. But it can't save you.

👤 あなた [1620s - 1634s]
If Jesus is less than god, he cannot bring you to god. If Jesus is less than human, he can't stand in the place of humanity. That's why John speaks so strongly. Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.

👤 あなた [1635s - 1645s]
So this is quite a serious matter really. John is not playing games here. He's saying that the between truth and error on this point is different between life and death.

👤 あなた [1646s - 1658s]
Between being saved and still standing in the condemnation before holy god. Now that might feel a bit intense for me to say that.

👤 あなた [1659s - 1672s]
It needs to be intense because this is serious This is serious stuff. We live in a time where Jesus is talked about constantly, and kind of shaped into our own image.

👤 あなた [1674s - 1686s]
He's referenced in political speeches. He is invoked in cultural debates. He is appropriated by nationalist movements. He's kind of discussed in podcasts.

👤 あなた [1687s - 1698s]
He's reshaped in documentaries. And often, 's reduced. He's a reduced Jesus. He's a moral teacher. He's a social reformer. He's a political symbol.

👤 あなた [1699s - 1728s]
Maybe a spiritual guide. But a reduced Jesus cannot save anyone because it's not the real Jesus. And sometimes, Jesus is distorted the other way. He he's lifted so high that he becomes untouchable, so divine that he does not really share in our weakness. God, Jesus really understand what us did what us like to suffer with temptation, sin, and doesn't know how how painful this will can be.

👤 あなた [1729s - 1739s]
He's he's elevated beyond our struggles. And our fight against sin. And that's not the Jesus of scripture either. John says test it.

👤 あなた [1740s - 1751s]
Listen carefully. Examine the confession. Examine what the voice is listening to is telling you about who Jesus is because if we get him wrong, we trust it in a different savior who can't save.

👤 あなた [1754s - 1779s]
So what does this actually look like? What does a wrong Jesus sound like? Let me show you two common distortions. What the reason So next the next two questions is kind of like, why do the redeemer need to be truly human and why do the redeemer need to be truly god? So I'm trying trying to avoid getting into that today. So if you're wondering what all that means. So let me show you two common distortions, and you will recognise them.

👤 あなた [1780s - 1797s]
Firstly, Jesus is reduced to a moral teacher. A kind of a a a wise person that we that we commit to follow his teachings and that's that's the end of it. And this is everywhere. This is the version of Jesus that sounds great. He's he's he's followed.

👤 あなた [1797s - 1810s]
He's admired. He he he is he is what have I put here? Proclaims. Jesus shows us how to love. Jesus reveals God's heart to us.

👤 あなた [1810s - 1814s]
He challenges injustice. He welcomes the outsider.

👤 あなた [1817s - 1839s]
But he's not worshipped. He's not obeyed. Who has had the displeasure of coming across a guy called Brandon Robertson? He's, he seems like a nice guy, to be fair to him, but he describes himself as a progressive Christian And my my issue with him is not so much that. It's it's this. Let me play you a clip.

👤 あなた [1840s - 1849s]
Listen to what listen to what he says about Jesus. He's asked the question, in thirty seconds, who is Jesus? Listen to listen to his answer.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1853s - 1871s]
My life to whose vision teachings and message I try to proclaim to the world. Encourage others to follow as well because I believe it needs to abundant life, redemption, and restoration of individual lives and our world. As far as what Lord means, we can get into that later, but that's my summary.

👤 あなた [1872s - 1874s]
Let me play that one more time because it was bit quiet, wasn't it?

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [1874s - 1889s]
I would say Jesus is Lord. He is the one whom I seek to conform my life to, whose vision teachings message I try to proclaim to the world and encourage others to follow as well because I believe it leads to abundant life, redemption, and restoration of individual life and of our world.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1889s - 1891s]
That's sort of one more means So he says, Jesus is Lord, is the one whom I seek to conform my life to.

👤 あなた [1901s - 1911s]
Whose vision, teachings, and message I proclaim to the world. I encourage others to follow him because he leads to abundant life, redemption, and restoration of individuals and of our world.

👤 あなた [1912s - 1921s]
Now to the untrained dear, that sounds quite a quite a nice summary in some ways. They sound Christian. They sound even Jericho even. But listen.

👤 あなた [1921s - 1930s]
Carefully to what he he's not saying. He's he uses what we call orthodox words but he has a different thesaurus. They mean different things.

👤 あなた [1931s - 1942s]
Jesus is Lord. What does he mean by this? You get that from the clip. But well, in historic Christianity to confess Jesus as Lord is what?

👤 あなた [1943s - 1953s]
He is has divine authority. He's the second person of the Trinity. He divine he defines truth. He rules over salvation, conscious and ethics.

👤 あなた [1954s - 1963s]
Whereas Robertson's framework is law does not mean that. He For Robertson, that Jesus isn't the eternal son to be worshipped.

👤 あなた [1963s - 1980s]
He isn't the final authority He isn't god. He isn't a savior who delivers from our sins. We don't need saving from our sins. Instead, the lord becomes something like this. He's a teacher whose values I broadly admire and choose to align with.

👤 あなた [1981s - 1987s]
That's not lordship in any biblical sense. I seek to conform my life to him and that's it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1987s - 1988s]
That's the limit.

👤 あなた [1989s - 1997s]
Notice this shift. Jesus is not the one who saves. He's not the one who forgives sin. He's not the one whom we trust to reconcile, to god.

👤 あなた [1997s - 2018s]
Is the one I choose to conform with, example I choose to follow. Jesus is a moral teacher, but not a perfect one. For Robertson, Jesus made mistakes. Jesus was sinful. He misunderstood the god of the old testament. He he he had some good things about that we should follow, but he was a falling human like us. That's Robinson's Jesus.

👤 あなた [2020s - 2032s]
And in some ways, to the outside, Robertson's vision is of Jesus as quite inspiring. He's he's loving. He's meaningful. He's a good human for us to emulate after, and the world would be a better place for it.

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [2075s - 2080s]
So this is so that was on a cut

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [2080s - 2085s]
Shaun McDowell's YouTube channel. I don't know if any of you know Shaun McDowell. He seems like a nice guy. was his own answer to this impression.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2090s - 2092s]
No, it's a This This was his So I'm gonna give you my thirty second take on Jesus.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2092s - 2113s]
You give me yours. Okay? Jesus is the second person in Trinity, fully divine, who takes on human flesh, born by Mary with age, sinless life, died on the cross for our sins, and offers us eternal life, it looks at through faith by his grace.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2114s - 2136s]
Go. I would say Jesus is the one whom I seek to conform my life to whose vision, teachings, and message I try to proclaim to the world, and encourage others to follow as well. Decided we the peace to abundant life's redemption restoration of individual lives and of our world. As far as one Lord means, you've been as a leader, but that's my thought.

👤 あなた [2137s - 2148s]
So at this point, Jesus becomes functionally indistinguishable, really, from any other spiritual guru. Or prophetic teacher or wise man or whatever word you want to use, sage.

👤 あなた [2149s - 2152s]
Which is exactly how every other religion treats its founder.

👤 あなた [2155s - 2171s]
Jesus points us to God. Jesus gestures gestures. Yeah. That's the right word, actually. Just is towards truth. I was thinking of a court jester for some reason then. That was but Jesus kind of jesses us at truth. Jesus helps us imagine a better world, basically.

👤 あなた [2172s - 2178s]
But he's not the way to God. He's not the truth. He doesn't save us. He's just he's an example for us to follow.

👤 あなた [2182s - 2196s]
For Robertson, Jesus salvation is about social liberation and psychological healing. He plays down sin, Jesus' authority to judge, and sees him as a social revolutionary.

👤 あなた [2198s - 2210s]
So in no sense can we say that Brandon is what historically is known as a follower of Jesus really. Christian, belonging to Christ, And he must be renounced as a false teacher.

👤 あなた [2212s - 2227s]
In need of saving. The only the only value you'll get out of watching anything from this this seemingly nice guy is to to see how wrong he is. Sharpen your sharpen yourself. But don't allow you be careful who you invite to be a voice in your life.

👤 あなた [2227s - 2239s]
It's a reason why the bible describes false teachers as what? Sheep's clothing. If they were easy to spot, the sheep would run away from the wolves easily.

👤 あなた [2239s - 2254s]
But they come disguised. They look they 90% truth, 10% heresy that leads you to death. Jesus, Brandon's Jesus doesn't reconcile. He he teaches. He he doesn't rule. He guides.

👤 あなた [2255s - 2267s]
He's a prophet of love, but not the eternal son of god. Not the one whom all the fullness of deity dwells bodily as Paul describes in Colossians. He's not the word who was with god and was god.

👤 あなた [2268s - 2281s]
Just a remarkable human being. If Jesus is only human, even a perfect human, he can't in he can he can inspire you but he can't reconcile you.

👤 あなた [2281s - 2292s]
To god because he's just like us, broken, fallen, sinful human. All of us are the same. He can show you the way, but he cannot be the way.

👤 あなた [2293s - 2303s]
He can model love, but he can't forgive your sin. Reduced Jesus cannot save you. He is not truly god. You're still separated from god.

👤 あなた [2304s - 2312s]
No amount of admiration of a moralistic teacher will will bridge that gap. But here's another distortion, bit quicker this time.

👤 あなた [2313s - 2315s]
This one sounds more spiritual.

👤 あなた [2320s - 2322s]
I don't think I have a slide for it.

👤 あなた [2325s - 2332s]
This one sounds more spiritual, more reverent, more churchy. It sounds like this. Jesus is god, so he wasn't really tempted like we are.

👤 あなた [2334s - 2342s]
He didn't really struggle. He didn't really feel or understand my weakness. He doesn't know what it's like to be me. He's god, and I'm just a sinful man.

👤 あなた [2342s - 2351s]
Looked human, but that was only an appearance. Was a facade really. Jesus is god, so and he only appeared human. He wasn't truly human.

👤 あなた [2352s - 2367s]
In this version, Jesus is so divine that his humanity becomes thin like a mask. That's last Christmas when Rachel and I took the kids to go and watch a film, there's a film in the cinema, like animated film, Jesus, son of god or something.

👤 あなた [2367s - 2374s]
Something like that. It was the story of Jesus. It was a beautifully done it looked wonderful. It was really nice. Was the gospel was retold essentially.

👤 あなた [2375s - 2385s]
But the Jesus in that in that film, he seemed very inhuman. You watched it, did anyone else watch that film? No. Easter. It might have been.

👤 あなた [2385s - 2399s]
Yeah. Jesus, he seemed very, like, etheral. He floated around almost. He didn't have any emotion. He seemed a bit from those around him. And he's he seemed not really that human.

👤 あなた [2399s - 2417s]
Really. He kinda like kind of like this other this other like an alien that's come to earth kind of thing. And no surprise, I discovered after watching it that the production company that put it on was actually the Mormon church. They financed it. And actually that fits really well with the Mormon Jesus.

👤 あなた [2417s - 2428s]
Because the Mormon Jesus is not really truly human either. But there we are. So you've got he becomes untouchable, but scripture will not allow that view of Jesus.

👤 あなた [2428s - 2444s]
Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, John says. In the flesh. Not in an appearance, not in a disguise. Not in some sort of fake projection. Jesus really came and took a flesh. In fact, Hebrews, the right of Hebrews put it this way, He was made like his brothers in every respect.

👤 あなた [2446s - 2454s]
Not in some respect, in every respect. Which means real hunger, real extortion, real sorrow, real temptation, real suffering.

👤 あなた [2456s - 2467s]
If Jesus is not truly human, he cannot sympathize with you. Praise god you've got somebody that can sympathize with you. He cannot stand for you in your place.

👤 あなた [2467s - 2488s]
He cannot represent you because he's not like us. He can't represent humanity if he's not human. You cannot relate to him. He becomes distant. He, he he he is so distant that we can't connect with him. It's but we're reducing Jesus on the other side.

👤 あなた [2491s - 2498s]
No matter how you dilute Jesus' Jesus either of humanity or his deity, you're left with a different savior.

👤 あなた [2504s - 2520s]
Paul says plainly, this is not from god. That's why the church has always insisted, fully God, fully man, not fifty fifty, not a not a metaphor, the eternal son who truly entered our humanity added humanity to himself.

👤 あなた [2524s - 2542s]
Our salvation depends on who Jesus is. Not just what Jesus did. And if we allow trends and influencers and even our own preferences to reshape him, we are not adjusting a minor detail. We are abandoning only redeemer who can actually save.

👤 あなた [2546s - 2555s]
So how what does this mean? What's the take rate we share? What's I amen to all that. What's the takeaway? Do not believe every spirit, but test them.

👤 あなた [2557s - 2578s]
That means discernment for us as Christians is not optional. You don't we don't outsource this to the pastor to be discerning on behalf of us all. That's literally impossible, by the way, in the in the modern day with YouTube with all the voices that can come through. We want to be wise. We want to be discerning.

👤 あなた [2579s - 2591s]
Next time you scroll through whatever social media you use, and you come across a reel, Next time you hear someone say, Jesus would never or Jesus was like this.

👤 あなた [2592s - 2602s]
Slow down. Pause. Ask one simple question. May not find it in that answer in that video, but ask this question. Who is the Jesus being described?

👤 あなた [2604s - 2617s]
Is he confessed as fully god? Is he confessed as fully human? Is he treated as the eternal son? You need a theology degree. To do that, or you're not learning this catechism to win.

👤 あなた [2618s - 2628s]
Theological arguments. I don't want us to be, you know, keyboard warriors on on YouTube, get into arguments online. That is to guard ourselves and to proclaim the true Christ.

👤 あなた [2629s - 2640s]
That's why creeds are important. That's why statement of faith are important. When you join a church when you join our church, my hope would be that you'd go would've gone on our website and thought, what's this church believe about Jesus?

👤 あなた [2641s - 2649s]
What's this church believe about the Trinity? What's this believe about redemption or justification? All these things. It's on there.

👤 あなた [2651s - 2664s]
Any voice that you allow to speak into your life, be that YouTube, podcast, books, Find out what they believe. Do they affirm affirm orthodox mainstream Christian doctrine, if I can put it like that.

👤 あなた [2673s - 2676s]
This matters to the parents in the room as well and how you bring up your children.

👤 あなた [2681s - 2691s]
If your children grow up hearing a Jesus is mostly a moral teacher, focusing on on his wonderful moral teachings. They'll admire him.

👤 あなた [2692s - 2704s]
But they need to see who Jesus is to trust him. If they grow up hearing a Jesus is holy and untouchable, you know, children will remain to approach.

👤 あなた [2706s - 2725s]
But if they see the true Christ fully god, fully man, who is both near and sovereign, who is both gentle and authoritative, they all know the redeemer that they actually need. That's the question. What kind of redeemer do we need to be reconciled to god?

👤 あなた [2726s - 2739s]
This also protects Evan in this room too. When you pray in weakness, are not speaking to a distant unloving deity. You're speaking to a Jesus who became like us.

👤 あなた [2741s - 2752s]
Who knows all of our struggles, When you confess your sin you are not hoping a moral teacher will nod in approval. Yes. Yes. I can you're trusting the eternal son.

👤 あなた [2753s - 2758s]
Has the authority to forgive and made the way to forgive your sin. For one once and for all.

👤 あなた [2762s - 2772s]
You are not alone in your struggle The one who intercedes for you with the father walked in human flesh. He felt hunger. He felt sorrow.

👤 あなた [2773s - 2794s]
He felt loss. He felt rejection. And yet the one who intercedes for you now is also the lord of glory. Seated at the right hand of the father, holding all the authority, So affirming this doctrine, this truth and knowing it in your life, it can shape your prayer.

👤 あなた [2796s - 2800s]
Because you know who you're talking to. And can affect your worship.

👤 あなた [2805s - 2806s]
I'm doing well. My slide today.

👤 あなた [2817s - 2822s]
Time time is time is gone. I'd to stand, I'm I'm gonna pray.

👤 あなた [2825s - 2829s]
Hannah, do wanna come up and start playing for us?

👤 あなた [2838s - 2856s]
Isn't it wonderful that Jesus is who he is? If you heard this morning and you feel in weighed down by your by your sin, Know that you have a savior that was tempted with sin yet never sinned. But he was tempted, truly tempted.

👤 あなた [2856s - 2866s]
He knows and he is compassionate. He he experienced everything we experienced growing up as a child, probably falling over, grazing his knee. That's a guess.

👤 あなた [2866s - 2875s]
Imagine that may have happened. He lost people he loved. He knows what it's like to be us.

👤 あなた [2879s - 2893s]
Yet he is the eternal son of god. Forever interceding on our behalf. He loves us, and in fact, great great swim and swims we'll do one day probably in this church is to see the the appearances of Christ in the Old Testament.

👤 あなた [2895s - 2906s]
Theophanies, I think they're called. The angel of the Lord. And how he intercedes and on behalf of of humans even then, but we'll get to that. He knows You can trust him.

👤 あなた [2909s - 2922s]
Jesus, we adore you. We admire you. We love you. We submit our lives to you. As the Lord of Glory. You are not just our teacher. You are our teacher. We aim we do aim to follow your commands.

👤 あなた [2924s - 2932s]
Because we love you, we'll follow your commands, but you're more than that. More than a teacher. You are our Lord. You are our savior, and we love you.

👤 あなた [2933s - 2953s]
Help us, God, treasure this truth revelation given to us by your holy spirit. Into your words. May we guard it, protect it fiercely, help us holy spirit to teach our children that we have a redeemer that understands us who is like us, but also is all powerful.

👤 あなた [2955s - 2957s]
All loving, eternal.

👤 あなた [2962s - 2975s]
If you're here today, and you have yet to submit your life to Jesus as the Lord of your life, the one whom more than you just follow the one that you trust to save you.

👤 あなた [2978s - 2983s]
To reconcile you to God, That's you today. Why don't you today make that say that prayer?

👤 あなた [2987s - 3000s]
Thank you that you like us, but also that you are like God. You are God. Sorry. And I submit you as the lord of my life. I need you to save me. I can't save myself. There's no other human that can save us.

👤 あなた [3001s - 3013s]
There's no other way. There's only one way, and that was you. Coming taking on human flesh, reconciling us to the father. We we praise you.

👤 あなた [3014s - 3040s]
Love you. We're gonna worship together now. I'm gonna I'm gonna jump on the guitar. Look forward to Ben coming back soon to to lead worship for us. But if you want prayer for anything I've just spoken about, or anything else, Maybe you've had a tough week. Maybe you've got a tough week coming up. Maybe you you're carrying an injury or you want some prayer for anything at all.

Come down the front and we'll together. Somebody will some of you will will come and pray with you. But don't delay. It's a wonderful thing to submit your life to the lordship of Christ.

👤 あなた [6845s - 6850s]
Did you do see a police car, they're usually on their way to somewhere, aren't they? When I was growing up, you'd have traffic police.

👤 あなた [6851s - 6863s]
Police literally, only job was to drive around and catch people doing things they shouldn't be doing. Do you have Like speeding, cops. Yeah. It's still we sell it in The UK, but No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [6869s - 6869s]
Alright.

👤 あなた [6869s - 6882s]
Now there's less crime. Just because you shouldn't I don't know. When I was your age, big big crime happened all the time was people break in someone's car and they would steal their radio.

👤 あなた [6882s - 6906s]
Why? Because the radios used to be like it was, like, two like, a size of a brick. Two of them, and they would slot in. You'd slot them into your car and all you gotta do is undo two screws and pull it out and you've them as radio. And so, obviously, when the radio started getting built into the car, then that stopped that crime.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6906s - 6907s]
Beautiful.

👤 あなた [6907s - 6912s]
And cars used to be really easy to do. But now that it's near impossible now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [6912s - 6913s]
My?

👤 あなた [6914s - 6924s]
Oh, I can't manufacturers have got clever now. Like, since we saw this car, wouldn't get very far if they didn't have a key because the key if the car's the key's not in range, the engine won't work.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6925s - 6926s]
They do the old cars?

👤 あなた [6927s - 6937s]
Well, back back in the day before the Internet and everything. If you pull this off underneath and there'd two wires and there would cut them and then put them together and it would make the engines out.

👤 あなた [6938s - 6948s]
Hot wire car, usually called. So that was another crime that I've got then. Yeah. Other third crime is burglary. People should break into people's a lot and steal their stuff.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6948s - 6949s]
Does that happen?

👤 あなた [6949s - 6959s]
That much lesser now. Because just be honest, most people's houses don't have that much expensive stuff in. And it's hard to sell. Still in stuff anyway.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6961s - 6971s]
What's it? What's that road that we go down? What path? That road we walk down and go? Going to the city of the car.

👤 あなた [6971s - 6983s]
Oh, that one. Know? Yeah. I think that's more of a scrap dealer that one. A car has been written off as not too expensive to fix. Mhmm. So it seems as a crack.

👤 あなた [6983s - 6987s]
Windows. Yeah. People probably break into whatever.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [6988s - 6988s]

👤 あなた [6991s - 6994s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [7024s - 7025s]
In the end.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [7030s - 7030s]
