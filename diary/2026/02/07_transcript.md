🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1140s - 1141s]

👤 あなた [1142s - 1159s]
It was not. It was full reading of some sorts. No. No. It was like Okay. Just draw drive. Okay. It was like the center was like you've he by hit the car. That's what the center I was nowhere near that van. So Maybe it thought you were hitting the floor.

It wasn't as cold as last Saturday, dude, was it? You came off absolutely freezing.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1189s - 1194s]
So can I just give a little bit of context to that? Elliott's target is to get some male gummies.

👤 あなた [1194s - 1196s]
So We're not gonna get the big fish there.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1197s - 1198s]
We stop talking for an hour.

👤 あなた [1198s - 1201s]
Patience and sending with us.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1201s - 1210s]
Patience, no. It's parenting for that just there's a reason why. Right. I'm getting big fish. Okay? Done is. We've been there, done that. We can't do big fish unless we want one.

👤 あなた [1210s - 1213s]
Oh, I thought you would show me a lovely picture of a fish that you go. Plan to get.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1213s - 1214s]
No.

👤 あなた [1214s - 1215s]
They're all lovely. They're all lovely.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1216s - 1223s]
We've talked about it since. You know the guppy with the beautiful tails and body with all the patterns on? Yeah. I saw the old one with the ugly face.

👤 あなた [1224s - 1228s]
The the The babe. Babe. Babe. I'm talking we're talking about the same fish. Don't know why you're getting to.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1229s - 1254s]
Not. Yeah? I'm not talking about what? The puppies. No. Right. If I could just finish to send this I was saying, the a Elliott's there's no extra information needed. Elliott's aim is to get some guppies in tank, but guppies are not the kind of fish you put in first. What you need to do is grow some natural, say, healthy in the tank. We don't have that at the moment.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1254s - 1274s]
Other than where we put the bacteria shot in. So what you need is some little fish that starts a little bit more hardy that starts just to get the tank being living tank. Now those fish are usually there's a few small options. We want them to be small, but you do need have a little shoal of them.

👤 あなた [1275s - 1275s]
Yeah. Nice.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1275s - 1284s]
They're community fish. But we don't want to have so many of them. The are have as many the actual guppies that Elliot looked like.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1285s - 1285s]
Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1285s - 1294s]
So what we need to establish today is which fish we did have a few ideas there, didn't we? Which ember tetras or something? Which fish

👤 あなた [1295s - 1295s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1295s - 1298s]
Would be good to a, go with

👤 あなた [1299s - 1300s]
Mhmm.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1300s - 1309s]
Going first. And b Mhmm. How many of those we can have so that we can still get like, six guppies.

👤 あなた [1309s - 1310s]
Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1310s - 1310s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1311s - 1327s]
But Yeah. It might be there's a couple of different types, some of which you can go in, but it would mean less some of which you could put in and Yeah. More. So we need to establish all the of ones that can go in first before Yes.

👤 あなた [1327s - 1327s]
Yes.

👤 あなた [1331s - 1334s]
How many we should have, and then from those the choice of an Elliot can choose So here's the thing. Like, here's the question I've got.

👤 あなた [1334s - 1346s]
Obviously, head to home, I've got a a lovely point system which helps. My impression for you from previous discussions on this is that real fish people particularly care for their point system in the sense that they think it's Well, they basically nice.

👤 あなた [1348s - 1350s]
Well, as nice for the fish.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1350s - 1356s]
What it treats it as is lift. And Imagine a lift. Yeah. Okay? It tells you it tells you how many

👤 あなた [1357s - 1358s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1357s - 1365s]
Safely lift so that it doesn't break. Yeah. But no one would ever go into a lift with that many people out there. You would just would get stressed easily.

👤 あなた [1365s - 1366s]
Right. Yeah. That's good.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1366s - 1367s]
Fall out, you'd have an argument.

👤 あなた [1367s - 1377s]
So they also had some point was Petrahome, they had some lovely one tetras that Elliot liked, which was the not the blue blue and red, but black and white or whatever.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1377s - 1379s]
They've got all the fish here.

👤 あなた [1379s - 1380s]
They've got all the fish.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1380s - 1383s]

She's got to do both.

👤 あなた [4290s - 4292s]
Sure. Other knee now.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [4293s - 4303s]
The problem is when one is bad when one is bad, then you use the other one more to help it. Then that's the means that one gets bad. And if you've got issues naturally with your knees, so it's just you just have focus on.

👤 あなた [4303s - 4305s]

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [4339s - 4341s]
Thought I would hold it by this. Just keep it a brace on.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [4341s - 4342s]
Like that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [4343s - 4344s]
I thought that helps. Got it.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [4346s - 4352s]
Pops has got pops has got a dodging in you right now, but that's not the same as brand needing a new knee.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [4387s - 4388s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [4388s - 4393s]
I mean, what we can do, we can always see if pets at home have guppies and go there next time to get guppies.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [4394s - 4397s]
Daddy, gentle, gentle.

You build up over time, you do so. You build up over time.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4414s - 4419s]
If you put all the fish in to start off with, they'll go Okay. You like, this is like

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4423s - 4431s]
That's why guppies are really good because they're all different colors. But, yeah, we've got four of these little ones, and what we do because the thing is, we wanna put loads in they all die.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [4432s - 4434s]
Like, you know, like, you know, something? No.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [4435s - 4444s]
But the thing is the good thing about attitude is that it allows us to learn how to look after fish without suddenly having a 100 worth of fish in the tank.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4444s - 4459s]
We gotta look after these. That was these cost money. You know? Oh, that 20 pounds for the fish. So we're gonna have to figure out, Elliot, to schedule for putting lights on. I need to find out a little bit of

👤 あなた [4496s - 4501s]
We do have There's some sort of fish guarantee that the fish die within the first day or two or something you get free fish.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4502s - 4507s]
I think if you probably bought a big one, but think they would generally say the reason they die is because of the conditions of the tank.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4508s - 4509s]
Not because of the actual fish.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [4509s - 4510s]
Yeah.

👤 あなた [4511s - 4532s]
I think that's general noticed they got a very interesting price matching system. I don't if you saw that last time, Rachel. On the fish? On the well, just Alright. On the desk, it's saying, well, we'll match any price. Mhmm. You can either get the discount now or pay full price and have it as credit plus 50% more than on your next purchase.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4549s - 4556s]
It would be worth us going to Pets at Home to have a look and see if they do have guppies there, though. Yeah. Male guppies as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4556s - 4568s]

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [4722s - 4728s]
Because actually, Jude, if you know every Monday you're gonna be clearing the bathroom, it's highly likely that throughout the week
