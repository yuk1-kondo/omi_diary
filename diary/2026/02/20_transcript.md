🎤 SPEAKER_2 [0s - 0s]
Okay. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [0s - 16s]
But I'm trying to be gay. So we'll get the fuck out. It's yeah. I'm gonna record you because this is ridiculous. Okay. And you do that. I'm trying to go home. I just didn't work. Like, you don't need to swear at me because your dog talk to your dog.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [17s - 24s]
As a neighbor, you need to walk away. As a neighbor, no. I You should be able to control your dog.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [109s - 112s]
And I'm literally It's, shorter than the height.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [114s - 121s]
So at this end, going around the top of here, we've got a very short grasp, a very wide entrance. And the distance around the top feels like it should be much bigger than this At the other end of the spectrum, we've got a very tall pipe bar that kind of has this flared rim that goes in a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [130s - 141s]
And it feels like the height of this should be much bigger. So what does this have to do with that? Do know what I'm saying? The answer is that people are very bad at intuitive the lengths of curves versus lengths of curves.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [141s - 151s]
Lengths straight lines. But, mathematically, we can use everyone's favorite equation. So we know the circumference of a circle is pi times by the diameter.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [152s - 163s]
Every mathematician knows that pi is exactly three ish, And, therefore, if we think the height of one of these glasses is more than three times the diameter, then we've got our answer. Let's measure some of these.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [164s - 176s]
I see that first. How far along do you wanna go? If we start from this end, diameter of this cuff is here. So this the circumference must be three times that.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [176s - 200s]
This distance is already taller at the height of the as well. So how far along do we have to go? If we look at the middle, I can use this pupsy measuring tape to get the circumference And we can see here that, actually, is a world smaller than the pipe glass. And in fact, people are so bad at estimating height versus curse lines that we can go right the way to this far end.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [201s - 214s]
Measure around the top. Or, in fact, even for this tallest stance, the height is shorter than the fulhamprant. So the answer is for all of these, the distance around the top is longer than the height of the class.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [214s - 221s]
It's true for pretty much any glance you ever have because it just feels very counterintuitive. If you can get a free pint of somebody about the program.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [223s - 233s]
That's what she said I did to her. She fainted with great loved it. Okay? She loved it until commercial break.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [233s - 240s]
In fact, I think she said it was sexy, didn't she? Very sexy to be raped.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [240s - 242s]
Didn't she say that? So, sir, I just wanna confirm.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [242s - 250s]
If you're testimony that EG Carol said that she loves being sexually assaulted by you? Well, based on her interview with Anderson Cooper,
