🎤 SPEAKER_2 [0s - 0s]
Okay. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [0s - 16s]
But I'm trying to be gay. So we'll get the fuck out. It's yeah. I'm gonna record you because this is ridiculous. Okay. And you do that. I'm trying to go home. I just didn't work. Like, you don't need to swear at me because your dog talk to your dog.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [17s - 24s]
As a neighbor, you need to walk away. As a neighbor, no. I You should be able to control your dog.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [109s - 112s]
And I'm literally It's, shorter than the height.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [114s - 121s]
So at this end, going around the top of here, we've got a very short grasp, a very wide entrance. And the distance around the top feels like it should be much bigger than this At the other end of the spectrum, we've got a very tall pipe bar that kind of has this flared rim that goes in a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [130s - 141s]
And it feels like the height of this should be much bigger. So what does this have to do with that? Do know what I'm saying? The answer is that people are very bad at intuitive the lengths of curves versus lengths of curves.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [141s - 151s]
Lengths straight lines. But, mathematically, we can use everyone's favorite equation. So we know the circumference of a circle is pi times by the diameter.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [152s - 163s]
Every mathematician knows that pi is exactly three ish, And, therefore, if we think the height of one of these glasses is more than three times the diameter, then we've got our answer. Let's measure some of these.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [164s - 176s]
I see that first. How far along do you wanna go? If we start from this end, diameter of this cuff is here. So this the circumference must be three times that.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [176s - 200s]
This distance is already taller at the height of the as well. So how far along do we have to go? If we look at the middle, I can use this pupsy measuring tape to get the circumference And we can see here that, actually, is a world smaller than the pipe glass. And in fact, people are so bad at estimating height versus curse lines that we can go right the way to this far end.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [201s - 214s]
Measure around the top. Or, in fact, even for this tallest stance, the height is shorter than the fulhamprant. So the answer is for all of these, the distance around the top is longer than the height of the class.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [214s - 221s]
It's true for pretty much any glance you ever have because it just feels very counterintuitive. If you can get a free pint of somebody about the program.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [223s - 233s]
That's what she said I did to her. She fainted with great loved it. Okay? She loved it until commercial break.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [233s - 240s]
In fact, I think she said it was sexy, didn't she? Very sexy to be raped.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [240s - 242s]
Didn't she say that? So, sir, I just wanna confirm.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [242s - 250s]
If you're testimony that EG Carol said that she loves being sexually assaulted by you? Well, based on her interview with Anderson Cooper,

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [0s - 10s]
I thought corruption was the rule on Novaria. The rule is don't rock the boat. Self interest is tolerated if it doesn't interfere with business. Analysis is driving customers away.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [12s - 21s]
The rule is don't rock the boat. Self interest is tolerated if it doesn't interfere with business. And Elias is driving customers Why don't you ask Keen directly?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [22s - 32s]
I'm Annelias' secretary. You'd think he'd believe me? That he'd meet me in some dark alley with his evidence? You work for Ainleus. Can't you just take his records?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [33s - 44s]
He's a croc, not a moron. He doesn't keep logs on his computer saying, this month I stole 3,000,000 credits. Keen's testimony and records are everything I need to prove Anelius is guilt in one pack

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [49s - 60s]
If your executive board loses a few million credits, it's not my problem. Had my own mission. Yes. Yes. Faith, a billions and all that, and I couldn't possibly understand how important your work is.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [61s - 64s]
You help my investigation. I'll provide whatever you need. Favor for a favor.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [66s - 75s]
In the long run, it is better to remove the source of the problem. Look, Shepherd, I don't like this either. You specters play fast and loose with the law.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [75s - 75s]
That's bad for business.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [82s - 82s]
Do you know why the matriarch is here?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [84s - 95s]
Something to do with peak 15. She arrived after we received their code omega, automated warning about containment breach. She came with an escort of Asari commandos. They took the last shuttle up to peak 15 with a load of crates.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [98s - 100s]
Do you know what she had in the crates?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [101s - 104s]
No idea. The commandos wouldn't let anyone near them. They seemed heavy though.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [108s - 109s]
Keen is off to pay me.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [109s - 111s]
Can you?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [111s - 117s]
I can produce a copy of Anna pass for you. I can't move large sums of money without someone noticing.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [120s - 122s]
I'll consider it and get back to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [123s - 125s]
If you have any love for the law, you'll talk to

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [125s - 129s]
King for me. Don't disappoint me. You know where I work?

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [129s - 131s]
Come talk to me when you chain your mind.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [153s - 154s]
You're the Spectre. Right?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [176s - 178s]
Always a pleasure, Spectre.

👤 あなた [179s - 180s]
Any news on that matter I asked you to look into?

👤 あなた [184s - 185s]
I need to get up to peak 15.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [187s - 187s]
Indeed.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [188s - 191s]
That might be difficult. A terrible storm.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [196s - 199s]
The managers have access as well. I do for that matter.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [199s - 200s]
I should let you go.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [203s - 210s]
Let me go Would you let's consider conversation a form of imprisonment? Then explain why so fewer wouldn't just sit and talk.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [212s - 213s]
Always a pleasure,

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [213s - 217s]
Spector. News on that matter I ask you to look into?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [217s - 218s]
The job is done.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [219s - 233s]
I appreciate your discretion. I hope I will never again be so careless as to find myself in these circumstances. I believe you require a garage pass as well I would provide a sum of 500 credits to serve that's unfair to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [237s - 243s]
An internal affairs investigator contacted me. She wants you to testify against Enelias.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [243s - 246s]
Now that you have my property, you want to dictate how I use it.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [247s - 250s]
I have no interest in a public spectacle.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [252s - 257s]
If necessary, yes. Do what I tell you to, or NLAUS will find what he's looking for.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [257s - 260s]
It is good to have all our cards on the table.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [267s - 268s]
I need with your contact. I will wait here.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [338s - 341s]
Spector, have you given any more consideration to my offer?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [343s - 346s]
I took some persuasion, but Keen has agreed to testify.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [346s - 356s]
That's a world of stress off my back. Take the evidence for safe transport. I think you'd help me being a specter and all. I guess some of you can be all right.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [358s - 360s]
So, how about getting me into the garage?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [361s - 365s]
While you were working on Keen, I got you a garage pass. Be careful up there.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [366s - 368s]
I have an arrest to make.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [368s - 371s]
Which I had time to change into something easy to move in. I hate skirts.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [372s - 376s]
This is an outrage. I'll see that you never work in this sector again.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [376s - 377s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [377s - 378s]
Yeah. I get him.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [378s - 378s]
Move on.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [380s - 380s]
You, Shepherd.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [383s - 390s]
I demand you place this beach You have the right to remain silent. I wish to god you'd exercise it. See you around the galaxy, commander. I owe you a beer.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [492s - 494s]
I heard the Any chance you had something to do with that?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [495s - 496s]
He was corrupt.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [499s - 500s]
Most people here are I wish you could take them all down.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [501s - 502s]
So what can I do for you today?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [503s - 504s]
You seem like you have an ear to the ground.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [505s - 508s]
There's a problem's up on peak 15. Synthetic.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [508s - 508s]
I have to go.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [509s - 512s]
You need anything? I'll be here.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [515s - 518s]
The access to the garage is restricted.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [519s - 520s]
I have authorization. Excuse me.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [521s - 526s]
Yes, that's genuine. Drive safely. The weather's supposed to be pretty bad out in the Alutsk Valley.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [629s - 629s]
Yes, we in or out.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [644s - 645s]
What did you do here?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [645s - 649s]
Commander? The geth ambushed us. We fought back.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [650s - 650s]
That's it.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [652s - 659s]
You expect me to where did they come from? Safe Money says Benezia had them in those shipping containers here. Arrived with.

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [659s - 660s]
Don't believe that.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [661s - 671s]
We did thorough scans of those. There were no power sources, no element zero masses. If Beneziah Sama's containers were packed with these things, there are many more out there.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [673s - 677s]
We fought guests before. We'll take care of him for you.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [677s - 688s]
I I appreciate that. My people are good, but few of them have combat experience. I must report to the executive board if word gets out about loose gap, there may be an investor panic.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [717s - 733s]
My brother is done, like, half a dozen euro camps over the years. And he said the Germans and the French don't give a monkey So they've got their speedos on. They've got their big fat, big belly hanging out and they don't care at all.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [733s - 736s]
I know. Yeah. Well, if you got a big you got the big Betty, you just go with it.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [737s - 739s]
Well, you even see it if it's epic.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [741s - 744s]
I guess so. Well, yeah, I really think about these things.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [745s - 751s]
Well, no. Try not to. Try not to. What about your exam? As you if you not got an exam as well the mix?

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [751s - 761s]
I got two exams. Got two exams. They're May. They're May. Early May. So after distinction? After distation. Distation's like April.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [762s - 785s]
The the exams are the worst bit, frankly, because the being in May, they could be tested on literally anything. And the questions will ask you things like, you know, what did such and such scholars say on chapter and verse or whatever, and you have to just know everything. So it's kind of like memory palaces help a lot but it takes a lot of effort and time to to really memorize everything.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [785s - 786s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [787s - 790s]
But when they're done I'm ready for it to be done and now.

👤 あなた [791s - 792s]
To be honest with you.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [792s - 793s]
That's good.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [794s - 794s]
That's good.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [794s - 798s]
Well, no. Yeah. Just kind of, like, six years now is enough

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [800s - 807s]
So Kate said last night Yeah. Were talking about Lent, what we'll give up and what we won't.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [807s - 808s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [810s - 826s]
And she said, I'm not giving anything up, but I'm picking something up. I'm going to do a daily devotion on Lent every day. Alright. And I said, well, I can do that. So I started looking around for a daily devotion on length today. Yeah. And I couldn't find one.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [827s - 831s]
But I found a daily devotion. I laughed my head off when I read it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [831s - 831s]
Oh, yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [831s - 836s]
Except for I can't tell you where it is. It's no.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [836s - 837s]
I can't.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [837s - 837s]
What?

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [837s - 840s]
It's entitled this that nobody talks about.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [841s - 841s]
Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [841s - 849s]
So it's talking about people who think they're getting into heaven and know Jesus. And they don't.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [849s - 850s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [850s - 851s]
Right. And

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [851s - 865s]
and coupled with man who looked in the mirror and then walked away and forgot what he looked like, And then it goes into, you know, just doing church, but actually not being being church, all of that.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [866s - 866s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [866s - 867s]
Yeah. Well, that's it.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [868s - 870s]
But great. This has cheered me up no end. Thanks, Kate.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [872s - 873s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [873s - 889s]
Well, yeah, I mean, no doubt that is an American one. Speaking into an American church where there's a lot of lot of nominal Christians and Maga Christians. And I think you're thinking about Matthew 21 or grandbath there, the Matthew 20 something.

👤 あなた [890s - 891s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [891s - 911s]
Lord, Lord, you said you prophesy on your name and blah blah blah blah blah. Way I didn't know you. I I often think of often think of drill witnesses. I often think of a Unitarian Unitarian Pentecostals, which very weird because Unitarian Pentecostals are non Trinitarian, so that's their problem.

👤 あなた [912s - 913s]
What was the one Mike was in?

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [915s - 917s]
The the the Latter day Saints,

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [918s - 919s]
No.

👤 あなた [919s - 919s]
No. That wasn't me.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [919s - 921s]
He was seventh day at August.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [921s - 922s]
Oh, right.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [923s - 924s]
He was Chrysadelphian, wasn't he?

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [925s - 925s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [925s - 933s]
Seven day Advent yeah. Seven day Adventists are not too bad. They're just a bit they're just a bit weird. They got a bit of an obsession with dates.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [933s - 936s]
So they're they're top profit.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [937s - 944s]
They were good. They were okay, but but gifts and and the Holy Spirit were not for today. That was just a thing.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [944s - 954s]
Oh, that's pretty mainstream Christian to honest, that bit. I thought he was a Chrysadelphian, which are definitely not Christian. They're they're they're non they're non Trinitarian for starters.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [954s - 956s]
Which immediately means you're not that bad.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [956s - 964s]
Because he did say when he gives his testimony, You know? Yeah. I believed in Jesus. I believed you died for my sins. All of that.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [964s - 973s]
And then something happened. I can't remember what. I think maybe Cath got baptized in the spirit. He was like, right. I wanna know what this is.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [973s - 978s]
And when he did that, then he he he gave up and went to different church.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [979s - 992s]
Yeah. And So thank you guys for that because he was not truly saved at that time. Yeah, I do wonder if that versus primarily end up kind of those categories, the moments as well as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [992s - 1002s]
Well, I wonder if the moments and the jokes to witnesses are saying, well, that first applies to those know, those born again people who think they're going to heaven and they're not.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1004s - 1009s]
So I mean Well every denomination it's for the other denomination. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1009s - 1026s]
Well, they don't well, not apart from the heretics. So that's completely different. The book of Joe the the book of Mormon is is utter nonsense. Kind of like And But there we are. Yeah. So I'm glad you're doing your I'm glad you're doing that.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1026s - 1038s]
Alright now? Doing okay. Doing alright. Yeah. I've really had this week's been good. Just to really really get on top of things. So, you know, things are going well. Thanks for asking. Keep the noise. Thanks.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1644s - 1645s]
I'm not worried about it, man.

👤 あなた [1645s - 1646s]
Strict call.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1646s - 1654s]
To be honest with you Good. I'm pretty sure advance I've got a fund for this sort thing. They've got I think they've got a quarter of 1,000,000 just sitting in the bank specifically for this sort of thing.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1654s - 1654s]
Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1655s - 1656s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1656s - 1665s]
Secondly, you know, the worst case, well, go and get a job for a couple days a week. And I'll be like, well, sorry, church, can't afford, you know, can't afford me kind of thing at the minute, but we'll get there.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1665s - 1665s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1665s - 1674s]
We'll get there. Well, thanks for calling, man. My best mate used to the the time that I've got whilst the kids are not here.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1674s - 1675s]
Yeah. Come back to more thing?

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1675s - 1678s]
But that's okay. I'll go on. Another day. No. No. Go on.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1678s - 1678s]
Go on.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1681s - 1685s]
On Facebook, Johnny commented on another story about referees.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1686s - 1686s]
Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1688s - 1696s]
And I just I just feel led to say to him, shake your feet. You know? Shake the dust off your feet, John. You can't keep doing this.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1696s - 1710s]
Because he just comes across as so bitter and angry and that's the thing that he's had in his life, all his life. His father before him, they're all about injustice and about getting and I know exactly what that feels like.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [1711s - 1712s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1712s - 1719s]
And and, you know, there were many, many times when Johnny had had a crash in the car, and he'd retell the story. And it was always his fault,

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1720s - 1730s]
Yeah. But he always used to fight it and argue it and go for compensation and and and this referee thing, he just needs to shake the desk off his feet and be done.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1731s - 1732s]
Because he's Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1732s - 1733s]
He's doing himself no good.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1733s - 1743s]
He's getting more more angry. He's doing himself no good at all. Yeah. The only person who's suffering is him. Possibly Michelle, but him definitely.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1744s - 1753s]
And I just thought it's say that to him. I also wanted to ask you if if you thought that was fair or if you think he's he's past it and it's all don't rock the boat.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1753s - 1762s]
Yeah. No. I hear you. You're right. There is an element of that. The other thing to consider as well is that he's married to a recluse.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1763s - 1780s]
Who barely leaves her bedroom. Meanwhile, Johnny just hates being home, and he's kinda like, what do I do in my life? It's it's it's very much Yeah. It's very much tied up in with his identity and it has been for decades, obviously. And so that's not a simple thing. It's not a simple just a one off conversation.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1782s - 1790s]
It's kind of for him to realize that, it's not him just fighting against being kicked out by somebody who doesn't like or like him rather. It's how we views it.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1790s - 1810s]
It's more to do with, well, this is your whole identity is caught up in you being a referee. Rather than being in Christ. And everything everything else every basis of identity that's not Jesus eventually breaks or or changes or but then, you know, it's I've spoke to him about that a few times, but it's it's it's you know, he's like it.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1813s - 1820s]
So it may be coming from friends. But certainly, I think I don't know, he's a few years off, isn't he? A few years off of retirement.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1820s - 1826s]
Do wonder why didn't they just let him attire? I know he may not be the best referee. He's been doing it for decades for gonna sake.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1827s - 1836s]
Well, he's the same age as dad. He's 66. You know? I think the official retirement age is probably 60 to 63, somewhere around there.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1837s - 1839s]
So he's over retirement age.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1839s - 1849s]
He wanted to go he wanted to go out on his own terms, basically. Wanted to go out on his own terms. And I think it was, like, next year or something. It was like an anniversary of when he started. I can't remember exactly what it was.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1849s - 1858s]
X amount of decades. And wanted and he wanted to do it in his own way rather than whereas he feels like there's a rival person in the board. This is his perception anyway.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1858s - 1863s]
Don't think it's necessarily the case. They don't like him, want to get rid of him. They have now they finally done it.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1863s - 1864s]
But he's been up front of the board.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1864s - 1871s]
I don't know how many times. People have complained about him, and I can understand why. Yeah. Because as I say, it's pretty poor.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1872s - 1881s]
Yeah. And that's why I wouldn't get in a car with him. But I just feel like he's just getting more and more twisted and bitter and angry, and it's just doing him and his spirit no good.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1882s - 1892s]
Yep. No good. He needs to take the dust from his feet and leave it. And if there is, know, justice to be dished out, then it doesn't come from us.

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [1892s - 1893s]
It comes from

👤 あなた [1893s - 1893s]
God.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1894s - 1895s]
It's his job. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1897s - 1900s]
Well, exactly. And that's exactly that's the right that's the right way Are you right?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1904s - 1909s]
I mean, the whole pastoral thing about getting her out of the house and them together and finding new ways of living It's a long term job.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1911s - 1914s]
Oh, yeah. It is. It is. And so I'm not what not anybody would up for, really.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1918s - 1919s]
But Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1920s - 1921s]
He's I he worried about him.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1922s - 1928s]
I know. He's he's he's got his health issues and everything else as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1929s - 1934s]
So it's kind of like because I wanna say you turned into your father. But he will not like that one bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1935s - 1941s]
Well, funny enough you mentioned his father's got a message from Tony the other day saying that his father's his dad's on his last legs.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1943s - 1944s]
Do you need to do about it?

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1945s - 1952s]
Any well, the funeral's upcoming kind of thing. Just be warned that dad's dying soon. You know? But, he doesn't like he obviously Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1957s - 1967s]
Alright. Well, I'll hold back my my my word for him and my thoughts if that's going on because I'll just kick off him and all over again.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1969s - 1974s]
Yeah. Well, you know, yeah, it might be wise. It might be wise. Just to wait and see.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1976s - 1978s]

## 📝 Analyzing Ezekiel’s Gog Oracle and Yahweh’s Holiness - f717e4b0-870d-44d9-bafd-1ce126c32ad2

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [111s - 120s]
Question, like, so The significance of women's 38, 14, twenty three The previous chapters promise a new heart in the resurrection of the dry of dry bones. However, the matter of axill threat, and so the security of this reservation is not resolved.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [120s - 128s]
John W Hilbert describes chapters 38, 39 functionally as the as a as an as a bracket end

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [135s - 163s]
We'll see such as complementing The scrubs as an end bracket.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [239s - 240s]
That's a complimenting chapter.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [265s - 268s]
Periscopes significant sink can be understood as the final step for the restoration.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [277s - 284s]
In short, this role the role of this passage within Ezekiel is as a theoscal bridge to the final chapter, Yahweh's no resolves.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [289s - 291s]
Shall be telling that the paycope is deliberate.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [295s - 302s]
Leading the audience ultimately towards regular scenarios. Regarding questions of agency, scholarly detentions remain.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [312s - 318s]
For Margaret Marque Odel, Gog is a defiant rebel, not an agent of Yahweh. He is not an instrument of judgment. For his plans of his own.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [320s - 329s]
Whilst Daniel our block emphasizes that Gog's actions are initiated by await service done on purpose. However, the structural arrangement of the text appears to leave a room for a synthesized position.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [330s - 343s]
Example, in verse 15, Goggs intentions seem self devised. He gathers a great host, a mighty army, to rise up like a cloud curtain. However, structurally, verse 15 is between verses fourteen and sixteen.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [348s - 350s]
And reveals gog suction.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [356s - 362s]
That reveals in verse 14, Yahweh is reveal reveals that he he knows Gog's intentions and, in fact, it is.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [374s - 402s]
He Yahweh's purpose in move of it moving. Not to bring judgment upon his people, but so that the nations may know me when you are god I haven't Structurally, then, before the confract begins, Yahweh speaks first and last revealing as both an enemy and an agent of let's see see Adams translation of a 16 as well, Yahweh's use.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [420s - 429s]
I will send you to invade my country with the intent that the other nations may acknowledge me when they see me using you, o god, to reveal my transcendent holiness.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [430s - 437s]
As John f notes, the recognition formula is the beat of the book and serves to structurally unify the various elements of the book around

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [442s - 454s]
Wider point is also true here where for the 17 marks a structural halt. To the narrative and introduces a degree of of interpretation through retrospection.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [455s - 461s]
Black writes that the verse portrays and self-controflection on history of Israel. For Alan, the phrase my servants, the puppets.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [463s - 476s]
Has a deuteronic stick uteronic stick ring. And there are refrains of familiar prophecies too. So verse 17 then seems to be vague and anchored from specific prophecies or profits making

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [484s - 492s]
Making the emphasis here more theological than historical. Gogg does not seem to be this historical From the North, Gogs, armies,

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [508s - 517s]
First 18 transitional shift focus from Goggs movements. Response firstly is Yahweh's wrath verse 18 that culminates in the of divine judgment.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [518s - 533s]
In verse 23. The structure does not climax with god's feet or safety for Yahweh's people. But in Yahweh's revelation of his threefold intent and purposes behind his actions, to display his grip.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [556s - 566s]
The structure flow then ensures that the reader naturally arrives at the recognition hourly's greatness. Entry of verse eighteen fifty leaves the reader unable to view our construct as historical military encounter.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [567s - 581s]
More broadly, the passage reveals Yahweh's holiness through imagery of cosmic judgments and added upon his enemies. Although the cosmic elements and the symbolic density of this passage is led. Sun describe the

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [586s - 601s]
This passage according to John Golden Gate as miss missing many defining in it features of references in revelation also often need also often lead the often leads to a skeleton is called lead anarches.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [601s - 612s]
However, the focus of the imagery here is to maximize Yahweh's acts of self manifestation of his glory and humbleness. In verse nineteen twenty, the imagery expands the action beyond the military encounter.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [613s - 634s]
To view the judgments that Yahweh is an act upon his creation imagery in verse when it's clear Hilbert writes that use utilizing the passage Robertson notes that, he's cosmic actions are comparable to the entire of Noah's floods.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [635s - 639s]
The mountains and cliffs are brought down by the great earthquake and imagery of Yahweh's shaking.

👤 あなた [641s - 645s]
Divinely. Grounded stability.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [646s - 659s]
The image here is of Yahweh engaging in what Hillbird describes as divine warfare. Alongside the cosmic assault Yahweh saw its confusion lead into his self destructing in verse twenty one and twenty two.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [674s - 680s]
Company that Durant Worth is the Nothic Imagery. First 20, describe the All the people

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [696s - 701s]
For block, these verses are a reminiscent of the quaking of the earth beneath the feet of the shites when Yahweh stepped down on the mountain.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [703s - 705s]
The sole victims of the forced his

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [714s - 730s]
Earth's real earthly reality being invaded by the chaos monster. Chaos monster is rhetorical imagery, not cosmology and descriptive of the symbolic language utilized by sequel this vine power and holiness of Yahweh.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [730s - 737s]
The imagery of Yahweh's mastery of chaos and theophic language are elements of a wide intention by Yahweh to recall the Exodus.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [738s - 757s]
In summary, the passage is is rich in imagery and elevates and elevates the oral call above a conflict. Bound in history even when language wrath of language is found is used to employ familiar of Yahweh's actions against his enemies.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [759s - 765s]
Therefore, the our cause intention is not to predict few events, but to persuade the audience to look to how his all woman's presence and his actions to have indicate his name.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [770s - 772s]
Literally, the oracle's aim is to sway Firstly, the local structure and the right trick.

👤 あなた [787s - 797s]
Exposed to possibly that Yahweh's enemies have agency. Rony is rhetorically deployed to persuade audiences point.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [798s - 827s]
God is Yahweh's dupe plan in evil, but Yahweh repeatedly asserts control for his own purposes. The retic then teaches the audience to not place trust in appearances or to fear seemingly overwhelming Amy's, instead to trust and recognize how he's holding us and where it is. Second, they are called the dominance by Yahweh speaking, narrating the events before they occur, teaching the how to interpret history. Now he speaks often in first person I will bring, I vindicate, I declare.

👤 あなた [828s - 828s]
I will summon.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [829s - 841s]
I will answer. I will reign upon. I will show my greatness and my holiness. The aim here is to force the audience to view the events as subject to Yahweh's sovereign personality. Thirdly, the lack of need of defenses.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [843s - 854s]
Supposedly, the lack of of the of need lack of need of defenses, walls or armies are left. I have to lead Yahweh's people to the conviction that they are to depend on.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [855s - 870s]
The primary purpose of this passage is not to bring assurance to Yahweh's people in exile for revision of his military might, The purpose is to resolve the theological problem created by the exile, which is how he's done in red.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [870s - 881s]
Reputation around the nations. The nations would have witnessed the Babylonian XL. An apparent lack, an apparent and apparent lack of protection.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [884s - 904s]
By your way, most people To unlock in nations, defeated shame people among to the defeated shame deity. The vindication of Yahweh's reputation among the nations is achieved both through the return of its people to their land and by demonstration of power as he easily he's the strongest possible to show his enemies.

👤 あなた [906s - 916s]
God, the representative of this enemy is not they agent through whom god soon has manifested. But simply the locus of the revelation where it's blocked.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [923s - 925s]
The of god then It's not the main purpose of the Oracle.

👤 あなた [925s - 928s]
But the means through which I always manifest this holiness.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [929s - 940s]
The conflict is manufactured for the sake of Yahweh's self revelation. In summary, the purpose of the occult was beyond reassuring people of Yahweh's protection

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [968s - 971s]
The field score message is succinctly stated by

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [971s - 971s]
Yahweh.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [976s - 987s]
Interestingly, the people of Yahweh do not have a role to play in the conflict. There are no commands issued, no cords of arms. The realm technists in this arm not Yahweh in Israel, but Yahweh in Gok.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [987s - 996s]
The theological message here is that Yahweh's people are to find rescue at you not in the walls of him, in fierce actions. Sort of, yes, defend people but ultimate security.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [997s - 1000s]
Is a result of Yahweh's compulsion to vindicate its reputation.

👤 あなた [1002s - 1004s]
And declare his own yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1004s - 1017s]
The other the judgment enacted by god upon his enemies is just the means the central point. The increased armature guard for lines, the recognition formula is used to argue that both Israel and the nations will come to a new acknowledge of god.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1018s - 1030s]
However, increased knowledge of Yahweh in Israel and among the nations do not comment the same results. The recognition of Yahweh by the nations does not imply an in in a conversion, but rather that they are forced to be compelled to bow down to Yahweh's power route.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1031s - 1044s]
Nor does recognition signify covenant inclusion of the nations. Or call for them to trust. And worship Yahweh. Well, Israel knows Yahweh as the god of the covenant this knowledge among the nations.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1045s - 1047s]
Is experiences upward wrath, not relationship.

👤 あなた [1049s - 1056s]
Through the return of his people to their land and the complete destruction of his enemies, Yahweh has reversed the trauma of the exile.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1056s - 1060s]
However, this oracle's primary theoretical message is Yahweh's revealing himself.

👤 あなた [1060s - 1061s]
To his creation.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1062s - 1067s]
The theocentricity of the theological message of this passage is consistent then with the book of as a whole.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1071s - 1087s]
This essay is demonstrate through exploration of the structure that this passage is steocentric and that's about Yahweh. It's about the indication and restoration of Yahweh's reputation and a manifestation of his holiness revealed through his pulled up wrath upon his enemies.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1087s - 1101s]
The structure of the text exposes Gog as an instrument used by Yahweh to Whereas the imagery elevates this passage above an historical military, encounter through the use of cosmic warfare

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1104s - 1107s]
Rhetorically, the passage has raised the audience to recognize.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1112s - 1114s]
The person's passage the conflict is the means through which Yahweh shows his grip.

👤 あなた [1115s - 1118s]
So makes himself known as Christian to both his people and the Mizabhak.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1120s - 1127s]
Right. I think we are done. I'm not doing anymore. Not happening.

👤 あなた [1148s - 1150s]
As I can do, to be honest with you.

👤 あなた [1159s - 1161s]
Two one seven four.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1172s - 1174s]
Any angels cry Only only

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [1229s - 1234s]
Mixture three. Five six seven.

Yeah. There is. Except it's more of an extended scene that was cut slightly, but let me show you. So this is the original version that we all know. We see Rose look up at Cal, she hides her face, and then he just walks away. Now the version is basically the same except for this part right here.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [802s - 808s]
And from this point on, it's the same ending that we originally saw. They also cut out one of old room lines right here. Let me show you.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [808s - 809s]
The crash of twenty nine.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [810s - 811s]

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [0s - 1s]
Sorry. We couldn't be sure what was on the tram.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [6s - 7s]
Can those work at trains controls?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [8s - 15s]
Hell if I know. I'm not assuming any goddamn thing. Look. You're human, and that's enough that I won't shoot. I'd like to know who you are.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [15s - 17s]
My name's I'm a Spectre.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [19s - 28s]
I won't look at Evelyn for us in the mouth. The aliens overran the hot labs last week, only Han Olar got outed. He ain't all there anymore.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [29s - 34s]
First, we knew the bastards were clawing into my command post. He had a lot more staff then.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [35s - 37s]
I'm packing fire and steel.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [37s - 39s]
Wanna fight with claws and teeth. It's their funeral.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [40s - 46s]
You got my support. The board sent an assorry to clean up the mess. She went to the hot labs yesterday, and we haven't heard from her since.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [49s - 50s]
Ignisia.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [50s - 51s]
She still over there?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [51s - 52s]
I don't know.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [52s - 54s]
I don't see what one person could do.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [54s - 57s]
A matriarch has the skill to keep herself alive for a long time.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [58s - 68s]
There's an emergency elevator out by the trams. This card will let you activate it. Can take you down to the hot labs. If you need any first aid, doctor Cohen's downstairs in the Med Bay.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [68s - 71s]
I need to know more about the situation in the hot labs.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [71s - 77s]
Facility's off the network. The only way to find out would be to send down the elevator, and I won't send my people to their death.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [78s - 82s]
Did the aliens come from inside the facility, or did they attack from the outside?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [82s - 87s]
You want my personal opinion? Labs like that existed in stupid crap that gets people killed.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [90s - 92s]
You're certain the matriarch is still in the hot labs?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [92s - 96s]
Hasn't come back here. You came through central station, so she ain't there. I've got work to do.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [96s - 97s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [97s - 98s]
I hear that.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [101s - 102s]
Hell, man, the perimeter.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [131s - 132s]
Omi the door secured.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [139s - 140s]
Thanks for the help.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [147s - 150s]
Every few hours They always attack here? An obvious kill zone.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [151s - 156s]
Their only other option is over the mountain and down through the ducts. They freeze like everyone else.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [156s - 162s]
I don't know why they keep throwing themselves against our defenses. Even animals should learn not to stick their noses where it hurts.

👤 あなた [223s - 225s]
Might turn these hotels on just

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [248s - 248s]
What?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [251s - 255s]
Do you know matriarch Venetia?

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [256s - 257s]
Why ask me, and not your friend?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [259s - 261s]
Because I do not know anything about the matriarch.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [262s - 263s]
Then why would I?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [265s - 269s]
You're a member of the science teams. Recently transferred.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [269s - 269s]
Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [269s - 270s]
What do you do here?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [271s - 275s]
Molecular genetics. I specialize in biotic enhanced allele specific hybridization.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [277s - 286s]
Think you could translate that into galactic? It's a genetic thing. Forget it. You seem less upset about this situation than the others.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [287s - 290s]
That is one of the virtues of the meditation you interrupted.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [294s - 306s]
Tell me about yourself. I am Molestia I Alice from the University of Arrays. Is there anything in particular you wanna know, or should I just spout random facts? No need to be so rude. You are interrupting my meditation.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [307s - 308s]
Precisely Sorry. I'll leave.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [311s - 316s]
Then I will return to my meditations. I'm certain.

I welcome you.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [320s - 321s]
Cautiously.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [322s - 325s]

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [325s - 327s]
See. I've been caught up in events.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [328s - 329s]
Sympathetically.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [330s - 340s]
Everyone here could say the same. We're now with forced peer. I still have a limited supply of equipment to sell.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [341s - 344s]
Given the situation, you should freely contribute to the Pointedly.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [346s - 349s]
I give freely to captain Bentralis.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [350s - 355s]

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [535s - 537s]
How are you holding up?

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [538s - 542s]

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [640s - 644s]
Congratulations. You made an illegal bioweapon. You think to make a cure for it?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [646s - 657s]
Our first priority was getting it working. We were close to synthesizing an attitude. Our notes and equipment are locked in the quarantine labs. Captain Ventrales doesn't want to risk more contamination.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [658s - 660s]
Is he right to keep people up?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [660s - 666s]
No. The Totten has a brief period of bility. After that, breaks down into simple protein chains.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [546s - 547s]
I let anything happen.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [548s - 553s]
Why do you think? The company wants to bury their mistake?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [553s - 553s]
Venetia?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [554s - 556s]
She's alive. She's here.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [558s - 564s]
She ordered ventralis to send you to the hot labs. She expected the rachni to kill you.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [571s - 572s]
Let's go collect the lady.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [574s - 576s]
Do what whatever you like. I'm getting off this mountain.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [672s - 685s]
You do not know the privilege of being a mother. There is power in creation. To shape a life turn it toward happiness or despair. Her children were to be ours.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [685s - 688s]
Raised to hunt and slay Saren's enemies.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [691s - 693s]
I won't be moved by

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [700s - 706s]
Liara is here because she's a member of my group. What have you told her about me,

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [706s - 707s]
What could I say either?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [710s - 720s]
That you're insane, evil, Should I explain how to kill you? What could I say? Have you faced an Asari commando unit before Few humans have.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [724s - 726s]
Can't believe you kill your own daughter.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [727s - 729s]
I now really realize I should have been strange.

Filled with his light. Everything is clear.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [11s - 13s]
The wreck knight didn't cooperate with you. Why should I?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [17s - 19s]
I will not betray him.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [20s - 27s]
You will. You you must listen.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [28s - 33s]
Sara still whispers in my mind. I can bite you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [34s - 36s]
Compulsions briefly but the indoctrination is strong.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [37s - 39s]
Can he compel you? He's not even here.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [40s - 51s]
People are not themselves or themselves. You come to idolize him, worship him, you will do anything for him. The key is sovereign. He's flagship.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [52s - 54s]
It is a dreadnought of incredible size and his power is extraordinary.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [58s - 61s]
Sovereigns not like other ships, Where did it come from?

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [62s - 75s]
I cannot say. The guests did not build it. Its technology is far more advanced than that of any known species. The longer you stay aboard, the more Sarin's will seems correct.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [76s - 90s]
You sit at his feet and smile as his words pour into you. It is sudden at first, I thought I was strong enough to resist instead became a willing tool eager to serve.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [90s - 97s]
He sent me here to find the location of the new relay. Its position was lost thousands of years ago.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [98s - 102s]
Tell me where the mugate is before I lose my temper. Of course, demand.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [104s - 115s]
I transcribed the data to an OSD Take it. Please. Knowing your relay's coordinates is not enough. Do you know where he plan to go from there?

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [116s - 124s]
Sarin wouldn't tell me his destination. But you must find out quickly. I transmitted the coordinates to him before you arrived.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [126s - 128s]
You have to stop me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [131s - 135s]
I can't His teeth are at my ear, fingers on my spine, should, you should.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [136s - 143s]
Mother, hey. Don't believe. Fight him.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [143s - 146s]
You've always made me proud, Liara.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [153s - 153s]
Die.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [191s - 193s]
I cannot go on. You will have to

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [199s - 199s]
Hold on.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [200s - 201s]
We've got Metagen. Maybe we can no.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [203s - 205s]
He is still in my mind.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [205s - 209s]
I am not entirely myself. I never will be again.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [225s - 227s]
They always said there would be a

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [295s - 297s]
This one This one.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [297s - 300s]
Serves as our voice.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [301s - 303s]
We cannot see.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [305s - 307s]
Not in a living room space as Your musics are colorless.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [314s - 330s]
We filled you with enough of this. Vassal is at the edge. Yet she struggles You cannot see her that we are the mother. We are Rachnai.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [334s - 336s]
Did you order your people to kill the science team?

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [337s - 351s]
No. We were locked away here. The children are beyond our songs. What will you sing? Will you release us? Are we to away once more?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [353s - 361s]
Commander, I don't trust this thing. We know it's kinder killers, The tank is rigged with acid. I recommend using it. They made a mistake.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [361s - 366s]
They let the krogan go too far. This is a chance for us to atone. She has done nothing to us.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [367s - 368s]
Your companions

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [368s - 369s]
hear the truth.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [370s - 378s]
You have the power to free us. Or return our people to the silence of memory.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [379s - 381s]
Are you a survivor from the war?

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [382s - 407s]
A We do not know. We were only an egg, hearing light of cry in our dreams. Ottone from space hushed one voice after another. It forced the singers to resonate with its own sour yellow the last echo of those who came out from the singing planet.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [408s - 410s]
The sky is silent.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [411s - 414s]
If I let you live, would you attack other races again?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [414s - 417s]
No. Me.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [418s - 427s]
I do not know what happened in the war. We only heard discordance. Songs the color of oily shadows.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [432s - 432s]
Harmony.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [442s - 443s]
You could have calmed them if I hadn't set off the purge.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [443s - 458s]
No. Our minds are not as yours. We can only learn to sing the inner harmony. Without a mother, children are lost to silence. You should not sing of them in and violet.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [460s - 461s]
We would have stood them ourselves.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [468s - 471s]
I won't destroy your entire race. You'll go free.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [472s - 478s]
There's a reason their kind were haunted to extinction. Better to be safe and let a dangerous race loose.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [483s - 486s]
I'd like to have the rachni on our side in the future.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [486s - 488s]
You can trust them to stay there.

🎤 SPEAKER_18 [489s - 491s]

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [0s - 2s]
What's our next look commander? Head for the new relay.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [6s - 11s]
The new relay could link to dozens of systems unless we know exactly where Sarah's going. We'd just be wasting our time.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [12s - 21s]
The commander is right. We cannot rush off blind. We still need to learn more about Sarin. Who put you in charge? Did the commander resign when I wasn't looking?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [23s - 27s]
I won't be a puppet for the Asari. Give the orders around here, understood?

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [28s - 30s]
Forgive me, commander. I was only trying to help.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [33s - 35s]
We're done here. Crew dismissed.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [36s - 39s]
Oviaria, report us away, Commander. You want me to patch you through to the council?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [40s - 41s]
Patch him through, joker.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [41s - 42s]
Setting up the link now, Commander.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [43s - 47s]
Is this report accurate, commander? You found Rachni on Navaria.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [47s - 48s]
Then release the queen.

🎤 SPEAKER_16 [49s - 51s]
Do you have any idea what you've done?

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [51s - 54s]
How many generations until they overrun the galaxy?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [55s - 57s]
Three. Now four.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [60s - 65s]
This is no joke to matter. The rack nine were one of the greatest threats the galaxy ever faced.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [66s - 71s]
This queen is different. She understands why her kind had to be wiped out last time around.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [72s - 77s]
I hope you're right, shepherd. Our children's children will pay the price if you're not.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [77s - 79s]
We'll be waiting for your next report, Commander.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [118s - 125s]
Oh, before I go, we saw Hayden in a newspaid about the Normandy. He's cute. Later, Sith,

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [130s - 131s]
Tell me you didn't hear that.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [133s - 134s]
Afraid I did.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [135s - 136s]
Shoot me now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [140s - 142s]
One of my sisters, that's Sarah, the youngest.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [142s - 145s]
What's up? You didn't come by to Easter on one family meal.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [148s - 150s]
Your family seems to be important to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [151s - 151s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [161s - 163s]
Did your father start with the feet?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [163s - 164s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [164s - 173s]
Took any crap posting you could get that off at space time. He worked his ass off trying to get recognized. Never made it above service.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [173s - 181s]
Third class. He was really proud of that too. I was not the least What about you mother?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [181s - 182s]
You haven't mentioned her.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [183s - 189s]
Must know what military wives are like. Strong because they have to be, hate to raise kids while dad's away on a six month cruise.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [190s - 196s]
She has a degree in planetary ideology. She ended up with one of the senior worlds. She gave up her career to raise us though.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [197s - 200s]
You have more than one sister? Sounds like a big family.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [201s - 202s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [202s - 203s]
I'm the oldest, then Abby, Sarah's the youngest.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [204s - 211s]
She's still in high school. With the board girls daddies to say he felt more outnumbered at home than on the newest.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [215s - 217s]
After helping Raisin, your sisters still talk to you?

🎤 SPEAKER_17 [218s - 219s]
Amazing.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [220s - 224s]
Things were tense between Sarah and Eve for a while. And we thought it.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [227s - 229s]
Sounds like a story you like sharing?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [230s - 242s]
Sarah got herself a boyfriend who wanted to go faster than she did. Mike. I didn't think he was a bad kid, just pushy. Lynn would send me these worried nouns, and I'd tell her to relax.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [243s - 252s]
Where were you when this was going on? I was on active duty. Sarah's graduating high school this year. This was only a couple years back.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [252s - 262s]
They were on amateur all suit at the time I was assigned to turn out look. Same cluster but a dozen hell why away. Close enough to talk regularly, too far to make it back in an emergency.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [263s - 264s]
I couldn't afford a fast packet play.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [268s - 270s]
If he really liked her, he wouldn't be pushing

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [271s - 272s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [272s - 272s]
Of course.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [273s - 285s]
If he didn't ask at all, I'd wonder if he thought Sarah was ugly. Damn if you do. Damn if you don't. Mike thought they'd go for a romantic walk in the woods because he figured it was past time they did the deed.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [285s - 293s]
She levered Mike face first into a and left. Didn't have a scratch on her. Good thing mom and dad had us all learned some kind of self defense.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [294s - 297s]
I took emergency leave and walked Sarah's school for a few days.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [303s - 306s]
Why didn't you tell the police?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [306s - 313s]
She said it solve the real problem. She and Mike would both become household muse. It was a small colony. I said it was her call to make.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [316s - 317s]
Mom's pretty pissed about that.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [318s - 320s]
You said all of your sisters learned self defense?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [325s - 331s]
Abby decided to learn the sword. She always looked really weird. Like, speaks they do great things to her figure, though.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [337s - 339s]
So what did you learn One of dad's friends taught me marine hand to hand.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [345s - 346s]
Did anything happen while you were home?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [346s - 350s]
My last day out, Mike was waiting for us.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [354s - 361s]
Wasn't happy. I wanted to snap him in half, but Sarah gave me the look. This let me handle it.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [361s - 363s]
I need to do this alone look.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [368s - 373s]
Then he tried to punch her. I swear, she just flowed around him.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [378s - 381s]
That's unbelievable. Sarah must be as good as you.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [382s - 395s]
Better. I'm more or less a straight up puncher. When he swung, she just she wasn't there anymore, and he fell. She helped him stop the bleeding and had me call an ambulance. She told the paramedics he fell.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [396s - 401s]
Before they took him to the hospital, Mike touched Sarah's arm. Thought he was gonna end up on the ground again.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [402s - 412s]
But he hung his head, whispered. Sorry, and started crying. And she hugged him. The Williams women are a decisive bunch commander who do things when we're ready.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [412s - 413s]
Not before, not after.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [416s - 421s]
Your sister's something else. But you didn't mention your father at all. Was he on deployment?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [422s - 430s]
Dad always wanted to serve in space. But he wanted us to have real ground under our feet. He say space is beautiful, but he can't raise a family there.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [431s - 443s]
I cannot rest from travel. I will drink life to the All times I've enjoyed greatly. Have suffered greatly, both with those that love me and alone.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [445s - 450s]
For always roaming with hungry heart, much have I seen and known. Cities of men, manners.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [451s - 453s]
I never thought I'd hear you reciting poetry.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [454s - 460s]
Just because I can drew you between the eyes at a 100 meters doesn't mean I can't like sensitive stuff. Just don't spread it around.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [460s - 468s]
Ulysses was my dad's favorite Every time he shipped out, he recorded me reading it. He had a dozen versions when he retired.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [468s - 469s]
Does he still like it?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [470s - 477s]
I sure hope so. I read it to his grave every time I go home. Dad passed on a few years back. He's probably still watching though.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [478s - 479s]
So behave.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [482s - 484s]
You mean from wherever we go after dad?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [485s - 486s]
Dead on skipper.

🎤 SPEAKER_19 [487s - 487s]
He's with God now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [499s - 499s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [499s - 508s]
I guess you have. I've met a few people who were really weirded out by my Because I work in space, I can't believe in a higher power. Jeez.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [511s - 516s]
Hello. Have you people looked out the window? How you look at this galaxy and not believe in something?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [518s - 526s]
Your beliefs are your business. I'm your commanding officer. Not your moral compass. Just my commanding officer, We'll have to see about that.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [530s - 532s]
I'll look forward to our next talk.

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [533s - 538s]
Should get back to my duties. Didn't mean to take up so much of your time. What's your opinion of me the rack nine, right?

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [542s - 543s]
Haven't talked to Doctor. Tucson,

🎤 SPEAKER_20 [546s - 548s]

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2s - 5s]
And you can see answer two. One who is both truly human and truly god.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [5s - 17s]
But let me ask you something before we go further. Why does that matter? Why does it matter who Jesus is? When you to Jesus, who exactly are you speaking to?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [18s - 29s]
Have you ever wondered? If Jesus were not exactly who scripture says he is, with the cross still still with the cross still save you?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [29s - 35s]
Let me put it even more plainly. If Jesus was slightly different, would you still be

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [39s - 54s]
This is not a small question. It's it's not even a theological hobby question. This is a question about salvation. It's we often talk about what Jesus did, He died on the cross. He rose again. He forgives us. He saves us.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [55s - 61s]
Through him we fund forgiveness. But what if the most important thing about your salvation is not first what happened at the cross.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [64s - 66s]
But who was hanging on it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [82s - 91s]
Because the success of the operation depends on who he is. Procedure matters. But identity matters more.
