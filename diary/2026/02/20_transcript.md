🎤 SPEAKER_2 [0s - 0s]
Okay. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [0s - 16s]
But I'm trying to be gay. So we'll get the fuck out. It's yeah. I'm gonna record you because this is ridiculous. Okay. And you do that. I'm trying to go home. I just didn't work. Like, you don't need to swear at me because your dog talk to your dog.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [17s - 24s]
As a neighbor, you need to walk away. As a neighbor, no. I You should be able to control your dog.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [109s - 112s]
And I'm literally It's, shorter than the height.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [114s - 121s]
So at this end, going around the top of here, we've got a very short grasp, a very wide entrance. And the distance around the top feels like it should be much bigger than this At the other end of the spectrum, we've got a very tall pipe bar that kind of has this flared rim that goes in a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [130s - 141s]
And it feels like the height of this should be much bigger. So what does this have to do with that? Do know what I'm saying? The answer is that people are very bad at intuitive the lengths of curves versus lengths of curves.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [141s - 151s]
Lengths straight lines. But, mathematically, we can use everyone's favorite equation. So we know the circumference of a circle is pi times by the diameter.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [152s - 163s]
Every mathematician knows that pi is exactly three ish, And, therefore, if we think the height of one of these glasses is more than three times the diameter, then we've got our answer. Let's measure some of these.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [164s - 176s]
I see that first. How far along do you wanna go? If we start from this end, diameter of this cuff is here. So this the circumference must be three times that.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [176s - 200s]
This distance is already taller at the height of the as well. So how far along do we have to go? If we look at the middle, I can use this pupsy measuring tape to get the circumference And we can see here that, actually, is a world smaller than the pipe glass. And in fact, people are so bad at estimating height versus curse lines that we can go right the way to this far end.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [201s - 214s]
Measure around the top. Or, in fact, even for this tallest stance, the height is shorter than the fulhamprant. So the answer is for all of these, the distance around the top is longer than the height of the class.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [214s - 221s]
It's true for pretty much any glance you ever have because it just feels very counterintuitive. If you can get a free pint of somebody about the program.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [223s - 233s]
That's what she said I did to her. She fainted with great loved it. Okay? She loved it until commercial break.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [233s - 240s]
In fact, I think she said it was sexy, didn't she? Very sexy to be raped.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [240s - 242s]
Didn't she say that? So, sir, I just wanna confirm.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [242s - 250s]
If you're testimony that EG Carol said that she loves being sexually assaulted by you? Well, based on her interview with Anderson Cooper,

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [0s - 10s]
I thought corruption was the rule on Novaria. The rule is don't rock the boat. Self interest is tolerated if it doesn't interfere with business. Analysis is driving customers away.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [12s - 21s]
The rule is don't rock the boat. Self interest is tolerated if it doesn't interfere with business. And Elias is driving customers Why don't you ask Keen directly?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [22s - 32s]
I'm Annelias' secretary. You'd think he'd believe me? That he'd meet me in some dark alley with his evidence? You work for Ainleus. Can't you just take his records?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [33s - 44s]
He's a croc, not a moron. He doesn't keep logs on his computer saying, this month I stole 3,000,000 credits. Keen's testimony and records are everything I need to prove Anelius is guilt in one pack

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [49s - 60s]
If your executive board loses a few million credits, it's not my problem. Had my own mission. Yes. Yes. Faith, a billions and all that, and I couldn't possibly understand how important your work is.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [61s - 64s]
You help my investigation. I'll provide whatever you need. Favor for a favor.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [66s - 75s]
In the long run, it is better to remove the source of the problem. Look, Shepherd, I don't like this either. You specters play fast and loose with the law.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [75s - 75s]
That's bad for business.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [82s - 82s]
Do you know why the matriarch is here?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [84s - 95s]
Something to do with peak 15. She arrived after we received their code omega, automated warning about containment breach. She came with an escort of Asari commandos. They took the last shuttle up to peak 15 with a load of crates.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [98s - 100s]
Do you know what she had in the crates?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [101s - 104s]
No idea. The commandos wouldn't let anyone near them. They seemed heavy though.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [108s - 109s]
Keen is off to pay me.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [109s - 111s]
Can you?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [111s - 117s]
I can produce a copy of Anna pass for you. I can't move large sums of money without someone noticing.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [120s - 122s]
I'll consider it and get back to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [123s - 125s]
If you have any love for the law, you'll talk to

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [125s - 129s]
King for me. Don't disappoint me. You know where I work?

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [129s - 131s]
Come talk to me when you chain your mind.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [153s - 154s]
You're the Spectre. Right?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [176s - 178s]
Always a pleasure, Spectre.

👤 あなた [179s - 180s]
Any news on that matter I asked you to look into?

👤 あなた [184s - 185s]
I need to get up to peak 15.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [187s - 187s]
Indeed.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [188s - 191s]
That might be difficult. A terrible storm.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [196s - 199s]
The managers have access as well. I do for that matter.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [199s - 200s]
I should let you go.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [203s - 210s]
Let me go Would you let's consider conversation a form of imprisonment? Then explain why so fewer wouldn't just sit and talk.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [212s - 213s]
Always a pleasure,

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [213s - 217s]
Spector. News on that matter I ask you to look into?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [217s - 218s]
The job is done.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [219s - 233s]
I appreciate your discretion. I hope I will never again be so careless as to find myself in these circumstances. I believe you require a garage pass as well I would provide a sum of 500 credits to serve that's unfair to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [237s - 243s]
An internal affairs investigator contacted me. She wants you to testify against Enelias.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [243s - 246s]
Now that you have my property, you want to dictate how I use it.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [247s - 250s]
I have no interest in a public spectacle.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [252s - 257s]
If necessary, yes. Do what I tell you to, or NLAUS will find what he's looking for.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [257s - 260s]
It is good to have all our cards on the table.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [267s - 268s]
I need with your contact. I will wait here.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [338s - 341s]
Spector, have you given any more consideration to my offer?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [343s - 346s]
I took some persuasion, but Keen has agreed to testify.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [346s - 356s]
That's a world of stress off my back. Take the evidence for safe transport. I think you'd help me being a specter and all. I guess some of you can be all right.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [358s - 360s]
So, how about getting me into the garage?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [361s - 365s]
While you were working on Keen, I got you a garage pass. Be careful up there.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [366s - 368s]
I have an arrest to make.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [368s - 371s]
Which I had time to change into something easy to move in. I hate skirts.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [372s - 376s]
This is an outrage. I'll see that you never work in this sector again.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [376s - 377s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [377s - 378s]
Yeah. I get him.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [378s - 378s]
Move on.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [380s - 380s]
You, Shepherd.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [383s - 390s]
I demand you place this beach You have the right to remain silent. I wish to god you'd exercise it. See you around the galaxy, commander. I owe you a beer.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [492s - 494s]
I heard the Any chance you had something to do with that?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [495s - 496s]
He was corrupt.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [499s - 500s]
Most people here are I wish you could take them all down.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [501s - 502s]
So what can I do for you today?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [503s - 504s]
You seem like you have an ear to the ground.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [505s - 508s]
There's a problem's up on peak 15. Synthetic.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [508s - 508s]
I have to go.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [509s - 512s]
You need anything? I'll be here.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [515s - 518s]
The access to the garage is restricted.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [519s - 520s]
I have authorization. Excuse me.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [521s - 526s]
Yes, that's genuine. Drive safely. The weather's supposed to be pretty bad out in the Alutsk Valley.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [629s - 629s]
Yes, we in or out.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [644s - 645s]
What did you do here?

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [645s - 649s]
Commander? The geth ambushed us. We fought back.

🎤 SPEAKER_10 [650s - 650s]
That's it.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [652s - 659s]
You expect me to where did they come from? Safe Money says Benezia had them in those shipping containers here. Arrived with.

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [659s - 660s]
Don't believe that.

🎤 SPEAKER_13 [661s - 671s]
We did thorough scans of those. There were no power sources, no element zero masses. If Beneziah Sama's containers were packed with these things, there are many more out there.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [673s - 677s]
We fought guests before. We'll take care of him for you.

🎤 SPEAKER_15 [677s - 688s]
I I appreciate that. My people are good, but few of them have combat experience. I must report to the executive board if word gets out about loose gap, there may be an investor panic.
