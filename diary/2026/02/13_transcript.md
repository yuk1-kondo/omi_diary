🎤 SPEAKER_4 [0s - 10s]
At day 11. Get some depth of the perspective. What you're looking at is an old mining town just waiting for rejuvenation.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [10s - 18s]
We're at the mine rebuilt and kick start this town's production line. There's a fair few building blocks around, but you

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [22s - 33s]
Cracking stuff, a mine that doubles as a house means the workers can sleep on the job. Quiet down. Quiet down. You hear that?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [37s - 60s]
Looks like he's seen a ghost. See if he's alright. You don't wanna go in there, pal. There's a lot of horror under the ground here. Put a decent blade my hands, and I'll turn the tables on these soulless suns and bridges and Maybe a sword, I'll make these caves safe for you.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [60s - 69s]
There's enough evil in Worm's Car as it is, an extra sword hand that you well. Get that order for a sword and slap it in the factory.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [72s - 72s]
Remember?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [73s - 83s]
Only need to design a weak weapon here. Cost some time to make should be on your mind. Now that's a worthy weapon. Come on. Let's get off with it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [84s - 92s]
Well, go on then, big hand. Come to work. Oh, who's that new mine of yours?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [113s - 133s]
Just feel the heft. Take these. First one, I reckon. I have no knack for weaponsmithing, but you clearly do. Like, time to get back in. If you wanna come in the APR, mate, you better get some armor. What you're wearing right now is no bother for a bandit blade.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [135s - 136s]
See you later, BK.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [137s - 145s]
It pays to listen to the folk that talk to you. That fella's not wrong. You don't wanna go in there without armor. Get suited up.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [152s - 156s]
Nicely done. You can get out any of your heroes in the armory.

👤 あなた [187s - 192s]
It often sits there quiet anyway. What? He often sits there quiet.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [192s - 200s]
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sometimes I pick him up from school. I just check. Do you wanna chat, or would you rather sit here quietly? Sit here quietly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [200s - 201s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [202s - 204s]
You should then chill up, sit down at me. It's just a chill.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [208s - 209s]
Oh, honey, you're working really hard.

👤 あなた [210s - 229s]
This is for tomorrow. Just wanna put some slides on it now. It's not very long. It's it's about the right length. Oh, I forgot to say. I'm I need to speak to these about this, but I'm planning to change and this will affect the order of service as such.

👤 あなた [230s - 242s]
When we do the catechisms, I wanna do the card and the song at the end of the service, not before the The reason being so what happens is you go down five minutes early and come up five minutes earlier.

👤 あなた [243s - 243s]
Instead.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [243s - 244s]
Alright.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [244s - 263s]
It's never got, unfortunately. Will. It will. If we're stripped on it. Well, unfortunately, we cannot I cannot I'm not saying no. I'm We need to have a think through it because every Sunday someone comes down and tells us service finished So we're gonna suddenly be expected to be up there within three seconds.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [263s - 277s]
When I've got 15 children in a room at halfway through their craft. I have no idea. So sometimes what I I'll do is I'll try and get them finished. Think, right, let's get them finished for 12:30. So Sometimes they're carrying on. Sometimes we have got them finished and I'm hanging on. Like, oh, you guys are not finished.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [278s - 282s]
And I'm so I don't wanna rush them because it's normally quite a problem. Like, right. That's it. No more on your craft.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [282s - 283s]
Nope.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [283s - 292s]
But six away up we go. So try and do that. This is not so much the time frame we have. It's knowing I didn't finish my initial point. There's a lot you've launched in now.

👤 あなた [295s - 302s]
You in school, you probably have a timer or something. To wrap up. So if I were my end, that's the issue, not your end.

👤 あなた [307s - 310s]
If we had a timer on my phone as well, time on yours as a five minute warning to wrap up.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [311s - 314s]
And then I have a little alarm that goes off.

👤 あなた [314s - 317s]
You have alarm that goes off. And then you can come up.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [317s - 327s]
There's also all the in the crash, though. The problem is is if they just all go, then there's no one there to pack away and whatever. Because they won't all come back down.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [329s - 331s]
Yeah. So there's all these kinds of thing.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [331s - 336s]
Like, I'm I'm not saying not to do it. Just would like to talk about a bit more because The reason I want to do it No.

👤 あなた [336s - 347s]
I I think Not just not just to mess things up for the sick of it. It's because it ruins the sermon every every single week. The whole the whole I'll tell you why.

👤 あなた [348s - 354s]
The way Pete and Me taught me is absolutely right. If there's no intrigue, if there's no interest, people switch off. They know the punchline already.

👤 あなた [355s - 367s]
Then they're not invested as much. But if you ask a question, and let it sit, and then the whole system is teasing out the answer, The way we do it in a minute is there's no teasing.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [367s - 373s]
I do I do appreciate that. You've just got to remember that half of your church leave the service. Halfway through.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [373s - 374s]
Yeah. But Okay. It's just this is fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [374s - 398s]
So, yes, that benefits you and your sermon lot, but it doesn't benefit anyone else. Because I'll have spent the whole of my no. No. No. I'm not saying I'm not saying that we're talking. No. Please, can you and our external processing? Please, can you allow some back and forth? If we're gonna do this, I need you just to I I want you to be like, oh, well, Rachel said it completely fine. We're like, yeah. Because I'm too scared to tell my husband anything. No. Look.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [398s - 400s]
Me tell you the impact and then we wave the impact.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [400s - 401s]
Yes. On. Tell me on.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [401s - 407s]
I spend the whole of kids church teaching my children a bit truth and then reversed. And we're working our way through the bible.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [408s - 428s]
I didn't have the capacity to write my own kids church planning based on catechisms, have videos for it and it like this big story is amazing. So it's slightly confused. It's it's okay if we do the catechism early, we've got all sorts of stuff that's part of ourselves, we've done our worship, we do a and then we come down. But if I'm like, we're focusing on this.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [428s - 451s]
Tell the kids take up your craft and go and tell your parents what big truth was today. And they'll go up and Daniel will go up and he's like, oh, got this. And Hannah's like, we made this. God is number one or whatever. But then we come up and we learn different truth. That is that's also something that's a little bit dry. I can see why you want it at the end, I can see why. I I think it's only favorable for those adults that are left in the sermon.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [453s - 456s]
It doesn't help the mums with babies. It doesn't help the kids.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [457s - 458s]
Of those kids' team.

👤 あなた [458s - 459s]
All of those are easily overcomable.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [460s - 462s]
The only way A person who's never served in kids' church ever.

👤 あなた [463s - 468s]
I don't need to serve in kids' church. Know, that we could fix all those issues that you just mentioned. Yeah. Easy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [468s - 469s]
Easy.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [469s - 470s]
Okay. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [470s - 472s]
The only way is patronizing.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [475s - 481s]
We can put in vigorous plan and make sure this works, Rachel. We can fix it either.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [483s - 490s]
That what I feel like that does is dismisses my point by saying what's reason I'm that is valid is to your whole thing about I'm teaching them a big truth, and then they gotta go learn another one.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [490s - 497s]
The others literally set a five minute timer. I set a five minute timer. Evan comes up, distorted. Send it. Ask people, can you go down and hop back away?

👤 あなた [497s - 498s]
Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [499s - 500s]
That's easy.

👤 あなた [500s - 501s]
It's fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [501s - 514s]
Alright. Setting a five minute time is really easy. You get your phone up. You set a five minute timer. Getting 15 children to be done by the end of that five minute timer when every now and then you won't be ready.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [514s - 520s]
And we'll be stood up and you'll be like, I I know I know I'm sorry. I'm not quite done yet. And we'll be stood upstairs.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [520s - 526s]
We'll waiting, or we'll be we we be done at time because you'll suddenly finish it up by those.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [526s - 530s]
So it's just trying to I will not think about it, and come back to me later and tell me if it's if it's impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [530s - 532s]
I'm not saying it's impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [532s - 537s]
Or not or or completely can you get used to me giving the other side of things and that's not me putting my finger on it would I don't mind that, but it seems like literally every single time it's a no

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [542s - 543s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [543s - 543s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [543s - 556s]
No. No. Honey, honey, the reason you've got leaders of different teams is that as all got different interests and and priority and understandings of those teams. Now I could just come and go, yep. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [556s - 567s]
We'll make it and then you would have no idea the amount or impact of it has. Please at least let me share it. So where you're like, we're gonna do it end of it. You didn't think about doing those things, did you?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [567s - 576s]
And so I'm just letting you know what those things are. We can do whatever needs to be done. But it will make life like, kids church has been going really well.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [577s - 596s]
It's quite hard getting them out of time. I really really really try every week to get up for that last song, but it's a it's erratic when we get told because eve because what happens is someone comes up and tells us when the sermon's finished. By the time they come down and they tell us, they were like, oh, okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [596s - 615s]
Right. Okay. Stripe and tell you normal. Right. Cool kids. Have a fish. And I wanna get my helpers up for the end of worship time and get up and the kids finish with a worship song and me be up there for it. But it's so erratic, the end point. Yeah. Like, and I know it seems to, make sense, but two minutes of, oh, we're still not ready.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [615s - 623s]
Sorry. Or two minutes of we're ready and we're hanging around and your guys ready. It's actually quite hard work with children. So it's just what will happen if we're not there

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [627s - 629s]
Oh, I'd have to wait for you, basically. It's cool.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [633s - 643s]
Essentially, And I can make the timing work. It's just a little bit of a it feels pointless, like, just don't do it with the kids, the catechism, which obviously is then pointless us and sad. Oh, no.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [645s - 648s]
It's just we spend our session stuff, and I the whole point can be So no matter what order we do it, and then you've got the same problem It is a bit of a clash.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [648s - 651s]
Yes. But when it goes immediately from one to the other It's okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [652s - 654s]
Of learning more than two truths in a day.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [654s - 654s]
No. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [654s - 655s]
I get that.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [656s - 667s]
But when it's so directly close, know, what doing is I'm trying to send the kids up this and to explain to their parents, go give the sheet, take Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [667s - 669s]
Understand.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [669s - 678s]
It just ruins it flattens the whole blinking thing. That's the problem. I think people would be a lot more engaged. If I didn't have to run the punchline before I even preach it every Sunday.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [678s - 681s]
So we can put the question front on the board, just not turn it over.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [682s - 687s]
Yeah. And Bob, what about the song? I mean, it's not just for adults. It's meant to be for the whole church.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [687s - 691s]
Does that mean there's no mini time anymore and no worship time at the end of the service?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [691s - 695s]
People are not responding to the blinking ministry. The nobody's come down for prayer for the last two months.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [695s - 697s]
Debbie told me it's her favorite part of the service.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [697s - 700s]
Yeah. Months ago when we first did it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [701s - 705s]
She hasn't responded at all, and I've made a baby don't need to respond by walking up, honey.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [707s - 709s]
People respond in their It's a chance just to Well, the song the song in itself is kind of a response really.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [711s - 719s]
A response in a someone who's not even a Christian can enjoy it. Respond way rather than a real serious pause and rest and infilling for the week.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [720s - 736s]
That's all. Right. Leaving a service with the truth of Jesus was fully human and fully man because of this is the same as and I will give my life trust in you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [736s - 737s]
I will put my trust in you alone.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [737s - 747s]
You my firm foundation, and that's your last truth. That you're singing. It's just it's just in some worship or I don't know. And, like, you know, just being able to have a pause of the person next to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [747s - 748s]
Are you okay?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [748s - 759s]
I would I it's not it's not absolutely completely hundred percent necessary, but I would very much like not to ruin my sooner.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [759s - 759s]
I guess it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [759s - 760s]
I get it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [760s - 765s]
It ruins every week, every time. What I would say thought it was a simple change.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [766s - 780s]
I think it's a shame not to end moving one segment from the middle to the end But you're cutting out the only really opportunity for adults to really engage. There's no children around particularly, not especially not for the first song.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [780s - 794s]
It's just a bit of reflection and just something a bit more gentle because the kids are in for all the worship and then and you're removing that just because people haven't come up to the front. But it does lose the atmosphere of can I pray for you at the end?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [794s - 805s]
Or if someone is just having a bit of, they bit of time then when the kids are not there. You're getting rid of that now and we're just going high energy for the whole service.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [806s - 818s]
Maybe one little slow song, but by that point the kids are struggling a little bit. I understand we want to The only thing I would say is you're all about repetition.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [820s - 841s]
And I also think some of these things are quite complicated. I think I don't think it's a do you you either want people to be enjoying your sermon or you want people to go away with the truth? And I think by having question and then the talk unpacking it and then like with the song that and people going away. Think it sinks in more. Think but but I'm not their concern.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [841s - 861s]
So I don't know if people have sat there bored. I think maybe they're bored because the concept of it is quite intellect and quite complicated perhaps. It's not very engaging topic in some ways although it is but only for people that want to know. I I don't think I I understand what you're saying I'll never think about what PG's me me have a little let me have like the second school.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [861s - 868s]
Let me look the last comment, please. In school. No. No. No. This is important teaching thing. In school, we are told, don't keep anything sequenced.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [868s - 888s]
What you do is you pre prepare. So for the low ability, what you do is you pre prepare them. So before you're going to do this exciting thing, you actually read the stories three times before. It's the first time you read it to the class. It's really exciting. The lower ability needs to read it to them three times before, which you think would be a spoiler but actually they need that because it they they don't they can't take it in first.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [888s - 889s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [889s - 889s]
Understand what you're saying.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [889s - 892s]
They may well have a question and answer catechism question. And answer.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [895s - 908s]
Alright. Babe, babe, babe, I feel like you took my head off a little bit now. Just need to have a little think. There's other ways I can deal with it. I can can just ask a second question of the catechism question itself and then answer that one.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [908s - 909s]
Yeah. Maybe.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [910s - 914s]
How does this apply? What does this mean for you or something really boring like that?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [915s - 915s]
Well, no.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [915s - 917s]
That's not boring. That's an the whole point.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [917s - 917s]
Well, not really.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [917s - 920s]
It's very human centric preaching. I don't like it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [922s - 922s]
Well, fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [922s - 923s]
It's all about me and how it applies to my wife.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [923s - 926s]
About no. Rather than oh, god.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [926s - 937s]
Gospel is about God, but how it impacts us. If it was not related to us, then the story wouldn't include us. But the whole point is it does. You have to say, so why does this It does.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [937s - 944s]
I know it does. I know we have to include that in preaching, but it's not the I don't need to be the main but that's human centered preaching rather than Christ preaching.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [944s - 954s]
No. No. No. No. Not if you're doing the Christ centered, but bringing in our into that because the whole point is relationship. Why would you spend your whole time talking about Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [956s - 958s]
I understand what you said. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [958s - 959s]
I love it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [959s - 965s]
Babe, I bet I'm sorry, but you've done 90% of the talking in you've it's not a it's not a conversation.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [966s - 969s]
It's you expending words to convince me. Sorry. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [969s - 970s]
No. No. No. Yeah. I'm not annoying.

👤 あなた [971s - 972s]
I just don't wanna talk about it now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [973s - 977s]
But if you came I didn't realize I was triggering a whole blinking ten fifty minute conversation. When you Not a conversation.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [977s - 979s]
Ten fifty minute dialogue at me.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [979s - 981s]
Let let me start it. I don't want it.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [981s - 982s]
I would didn't want to I'm not talking about this now.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [982s - 989s]
I'm saying two different things. You come and say, Rachel, I'm thinking about changing this to this. No. I'm gonna get them having a meeting together.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [989s - 1014s]
With the service leaders because we're doing this. Already decided it. If you came and said, what do you think about that? I I I really need to do this thinking about putting it at the end. But in your head, you've already created a new order of service. You're printing it out. You're telling the ministry leaders, you're jumping ahead on it. So now you're really annoyed because in your head, this is what's happening. I've planned out the whole year. You need to get to point before that. It doesn't work with team. It doesn't work. And then what happens is I have to come here.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1014s - 1015s]
I'm not worried about that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1015s - 1025s]
That. It's the the sheer amount of words that you're speaking at me. Before I can even reply. I don't need all that. You've said your piece. That was enough.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1025s - 1030s]
I don't need I wasn't saying my piece. Was trying to help you understand. So when I was coming in and saying about the pre read, I I would love to make sure I'm know that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1031s - 1037s]
In my head, I was in middle of doing this task, and so that's probably part of my why I'm getting frustrated. Because it's suddenly becoming a full on.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1037s - 1046s]
It's fine. But you told me when changing this. I'm telling the ministry leaders. So it makes me a bit more like oh, panic as in Yes. Well, I need to tell you why what? There's no dialogue on this?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1046s - 1050s]
What? You can't just decide stuff and not talk to anyone.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1052s - 1053s]
You're not trapped. Fair enough.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1054s - 1055s]
Don't you dare?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1055s - 1061s]
No. I'm pointing out that the difference between I I've got this idea. What do we think?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1062s - 1063s]
Even if you think it's the best idea I know you've got reaction on everything is an immediate hand break.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1065s - 1070s]
And then you come around to things, or you don't, and that's fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1072s - 1074s]
But so maybe I should think about how I If you don't have other elders, you cannot make just a

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1074s - 1076s]
Well, I've got elders at the minute, it's just me.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1076s - 1083s]
It's not just you though. You still got a team that you need to value. You need to talk through these things. Value me as your children's work leader.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1083s - 1086s]
I do value you. I've I've taken on board your Yep.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1086s - 1086s]
Yep.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1087s - 1087s]
Yep.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [1087s - 1088s]
What's going on?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1088s - 1089s]
You seem too much. You're you're I'm not No.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1092s - 1092s]
You you said your pit you said your point.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1092s - 1098s]
I agree. With you. I'm thinking already about what to change. I I'm middle of doing another task.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1098s - 1099s]
Okay. Okay. Fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1100s - 1103s]
And Well it's just a bit too much, saw.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1103s - 1108s]
Well, maybe, but you predecided something about a change that I'm telling you. I don't know if that's the best change, and I've like you to pay that.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1108s - 1108s]
Unusual.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1111s - 1113s]
You'll pry me yourself?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1117s - 1122s]
So random babe is a five minute change. You can't freaking deal with any change.

### STT生テキスト

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [0s - 5s]
I don't wanna always come in and be like, no. Know. It's just I panic.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [5s - 36s]
Like, you So I'd just like to give a full argument before you come back. I know it's a flaw of my mine. I like to give every single point because what I want is to clarify everything because what I think will otherwise happen, and I know it's not conducive to conversation, it's not a necessarily helpful thing but my head behind it is what will happen is you'll then come back and say, and if I've I I've already got like a big long list. So I always think if I just do my speech first, you hit everything and then come back with something I've not thought about, and then I'll have a think on that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [36s - 46s]
But rather than go through a conversation the whole time I'm thinking, yeah, but there's still other points that I haven't raised yet. I just think, let me tell you everything Yeah. So that you've got a really clear picture.

👤 あなた [46s - 49s]
Yeah. No. That's fine. That's fair.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [50s - 51s]
I mean And I'm not saying that's I got partly for because I think I I'm wrongly on reflection assumed that your no.

👤 あなた [58s - 69s]
Your unwillingness to just go with a simple idea Why is Rachel being difficult about this? Why one day I'd longed for you to go, oh, good idea. Yeah. Let's do it.

👤 あなた [70s - 78s]
That's what and so it's kinda like but that's just not, you know, I'm of other elements to it as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [78s - 84s]
But still, just appreciate that for you. It does seem like a simple thing it'd be very frustrating for someone to come in and be like, yeah. It's not as simple as you think.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [86s - 87s]
And that is annoying.

👤 あなた [87s - 92s]
I don't think just every single time, that is even more annoying. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [92s - 113s]
I think everything. I appreciate it. I do appreciate it is. What I would like that there's sometimes in the early stage of of thinking is a just, you know, I'm just thinking about this. But you when you come in and say, I've changed the order, I'm telling the ministry leaders, everyone's gonna do it. It's a bit like it's already set up to fail in terms of a dialogue.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [114s - 120s]
And it's like it's because you're thinking and you're processing everything internally.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [124s - 124s]
Yeah.

👤 あなた [126s - 127s]
That's fine. Yeah. Anyway, I'm cracking it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [127s - 136s]
And I and I I I I appreciate I am difficult sometimes, but sometimes I'm not difficult. I'm literally sharing a valid point from a different point of view.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [136s - 151s]
And that might be difficult for you because it's not conducive to what you want. But I would say that you're being difficult I I could say that coming up with ideas that are just not considerate to the children's work that I've put so much effort into.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [152s - 153s]
So I could say that.

👤 あなた [154s - 160s]
I could occur in the conversation and say, look, I think the way we're doing this order service is ruining the whole summon series.

👤 あなた [161s - 170s]
I'd like to move it to the end. That might be that might be a better way of doing it. Is it possible for us to move that segment to the end you guys come up earlier?

👤 あなた [171s - 172s]
That's what I that's what I could have I think just acknowledging brilliant.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [172s - 181s]
It just makes it seem a little bit like you're picking something that works for you and forgetting that that many people make the Sunday service work.

👤 あなた [181s - 186s]
But for me, it's a simple in my head, initially, it was a simple Yeah.

👤 あなた [187s - 189s]
Because you're thinking literally moving a five minute segment from there to the But but then what I would say is there's a you need what you need to do is start to realize you're not as good as you think you are.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [198s - 220s]
Therefore, you need to stop making decisions on your own and assuming that you're what no. It's just this is valid. I'm the same with kids church and acknowledging that at actually maybe other people when I come up with an idea I think yeah courses make sense maybe I'm missing something I can't see and that's the value of having other people involved in this. And it's the strength. And so it's just fine.

👤 あなた [220s - 239s]
I don't mind that. I don't mind people come back. Mean, it's just I guess, the way that we communicate is something about it that gets my go. I'm you can see very clearly that I'm always eventually responsive and go, okay. I'm reflection. That is right. Yeah. Maybe that was not a good idea. That's easy for me to I don't mind that.

👤 あなた [239s - 243s]
No. It's just the way that we communicate for some reason. Because my blinking go.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [243s - 269s]
Because you automatically go oh, here she goes. She's being difficult. She's deliberately showing slowing things down. She can't cope with change. Whereas I'm just coming in as a leader kids church to go, hold on. And then also just thinking things beyond, like, alright, let's just think about this. You you you've seen an idea. It fits your problem. You're not interested in considering any other ideas because that's you. You go to a restaurant, you see a meal you want, great.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [269s - 276s]
We'll do that. I'm a bit more like, right. Woah. We need to look at all these other days because actually, don't think yours is the best.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [277s - 297s]
've actually missed out on the mixed that's only $2.99 for today only. Like, hold on. Let's just listen to some other people and get some contributions here. Or someone's saying, that actually the healthiest choice for you? And you might be like, I don't want it. I just I don't can't be bothered to think of other ideas. This is the choice I want on the menu. And, like, the the thing is you are working with other people.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [297s - 314s]
And you have really done it. If you wanna manage kids church and need it as well, if you want to be, you know, aware of all the things that are going on, and then make an informed decision from there for fine. But I think your decision was based on want this at the end, that works fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [315s - 322s]
But you've forgotten that the Sunday service is just made up of lots of other elements. And I was just bringing some of those things in so that you can think again about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [323s - 337s]
Doesn't mean the answer's gonna be different, but I wanna give you all of the ideas so that you can then re go back through and then go right. Now let's just see. Because you would just like, it just needs to change. I'm move it. Now I want to give you all the information and now you go right.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [337s - 341s]
Shall I move it? And then you weigh up all those things and then you can make a decision.

👤 あなた [341s - 350s]
Yeah. Yeah. No. That's fine. Yeah. That makes as I said, it makes sense. What you're saying makes sense. And hence my apology text.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [351s - 352s]
I you know what I I fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [352s - 361s]
I I I do worry about no one comes up to the front for ministry. Let's just not do it anymore. I just worry that Gotcha.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [361s - 377s]
No I worry that we will miss out on that opportunity. And if it's no space for it, it will never happen. There will never be that opportunity where someone just sits down and bursts into tears because they've just it finally got to the end of the service. Nothing to do with the sermon.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [378s - 388s]
And the person next to them can just check-in with them. Or there's just a pause time, a slowdown. Because you have to admit, the first forty five minutes are service is usually pretty high energy.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [388s - 396s]
There's not really a lot of and I think you can go through the motions of high energy work worship, high energy church, and not even be a Christian.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [397s - 408s]
It's hard to go through those low calm and not engage with God or not choose whether you're going to or not. Yeah. So it would be a shame to cut that out.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [409s - 422s]
I do appreciate you're definitely someone who doesn't like to give away the end before the beginning. And I'm someone who is the opposite to that. I don't know what right and what's wrong.

👤 あなた [423s - 432s]
Obviously, Peter Mead's saying keep the thing, If you have a sermon where it goes, today I'm gonna be talking about this. And this is what I'm gonna this is what it is. No. It can be for some people.

👤 あなた [433s - 437s]
Can be like I don't yeah. Could be like, oh, well I've no longer invested that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [437s - 462s]
I appreciate it. It's like John giving you the speech before he even does it for a sermon. But what I would say though is most people really understand it. It is a question and answer, but the majority people in our church doesn't really make whole lot of sense to, especially as we go to some slightly more doctrinally heavy So a Adam because of Adam's sin, it was all blah blah blah blah blah Well, that needs teaching into. Yeah.

👤 あなた [462s - 464s]
I done it. I've taught into every single one of them.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [464s - 492s]
No. No. No. I know. But what I'm saying is I I don't think just the question and answer will make people switch off. I think it's a bit like oh, I don't really get that or okay. That's pretty wordy. And then it's like right. Okay. What does it actually mean? Come on. Tell me. I think there's a whereas I I wonder whether the the the nature of these sermons being very doctrine heavy people will completely miss it if they don't even know where it's going.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [493s - 505s]
Because it's just kind of confused Whereas if you've got the question and answer, you can start to hear things. When you switch off, because let's be fairies, at least 50% of people in the room will not be listening to your sermon properly. At least.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [506s - 536s]
Because that's just the nature of things. So no offense on you. So no offense on anything. I can go to the best in the world if my head is all other things because because it is, and that's normal and that's okay. Or it might be on the worship and you're reflecting on something. You've got to think I really need to do with this and you're talking about something and you kind of pick up on bits, hearing things and seeing how it feeds into the question and answer that we've already said. You might only get the old bit. I was listening to that podcast from Dan and Jay on Cain's wife. I definitely switched off with some of it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [537s - 545s]
But because I knew what he said at the very beginning, right at the very beginning, said, I do not see any evidence for any other people other than Adam and Eve.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [545s - 575s]
And they they created or they populated from children. And so then when I flipped in and out, I had that comp But I I I had that context for when I came in and out everything because I already knew the main point. So then everything else made sense. If you'd have kept that, then I'd have to listen with deep detail to every little bit Yeah. Which I just couldn't do. And I'd switch I just can't do because something comes up or someone's baby cries or a toddler or I spill my train of all.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [577s - 577s]
Talk about this.

👤 あなた [577s - 587s]
I think it goes inductive and deductives. Serving style. So some of them, if people get it straight away, leave it at build towards the end at the very end.

👤 あなた [588s - 594s]
If it's something hard to get your head around, make it obvious throughout.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [594s - 625s]
Don't don't And I just wonder whether that's what this is. I think if you're giving a I think so so when you have those things where there's a really profound like, so being in Christ, and like the profoundness of some of those things, you want it to hit later on in the sermon when you've built things up. You've either plunged people to the depth and then you've brought them back or you've you're revealing slowly slowly and then a big thing comes and it hits people and it's profound. It's like wow. That's not this kind of sermon.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [626s - 639s]
This is explaining what we believe and why and why that's important. Deconstructing. And don't forget, you need to explain why So towards it, where we created unable to keep God's law.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [640s - 641s]
Is that the the question, is it?

👤 あなた [642s - 644s]
No. No. No. I'm I'm going through all of them.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [644s - 645s]
Okay.

👤 あなた [645s - 649s]
And then Oh, yeah. I'm doing in sections and then explaining why this what this all means and why it matters.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [649s - 660s]
So but what I would say is on the why it matters, it's still quite doctrine heavy. What you also need to do is give people real life I know that.

👤 あなた [660s - 665s]
What happened in this. I get that, but I really I I babe, it's too late that Simon's written now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [665s - 667s]
No. No. I've told something I've told about this seven series.

👤 あなた [668s - 674s]
But secondly, it is a teaching series. Is the the main purpose Yeah. Okay. I do want application.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [675s - 680s]
You know, I would never teach a child how to read, but never give them a book and just give them words on a piece of paper.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [680s - 680s]
Yeah.

👤 あなた [680s - 686s]
I'm not doing that either. Vandem all I'm not doing that either. But the main problem we have in our church is people know our blinking at all.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [686s - 687s]
No. No.

👤 あなた [687s - 689s]
No. Are loony.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [689s - 750s]
Yes. But the reason we're doing this because people are believing points, comments, little subtleties that are wrong. You used to tell people what those are. If you don't believe that Adams was this is this, when you hear people saying this, that that sounds great. Or when you when we talk about sin and we when or were we were we made unable to keep God's law? Or or whatever it is, just a it's a twinge so people can then go have I actually been living in the belief of that truth and are the choices of the doctrine that I'm following or have I actually slipped into false doctrine? That's actually impacted the way that I've gone about my life because I've assumed that actually, yes, God made man or woman to be married, but because of the full it means we're all we're all made differently and that's how we live our life now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [750s - 761s]
Okay to be gay. Well, no. The whole point is that we're there's still that is god's perfect, that we're still in desire. That there's that teaches us on these things.

👤 あなた [762s - 762s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [762s - 768s]
And and what I just need is for this it's you just gotta you gotta do it.

👤 あなた [768s - 783s]
What we could is what we really help you cannot docs. Really for me? Is I'll give you part two in this format here. And you just sit through it, read it, because you're really good at this.

👤 あなた [784s - 790s]
Have it dictator ready and go and go through each of the question.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [793s - 796s]
The example you just gave there is just give me a couple of those each What I miss is I don't necessarily know the answer to all because I don't know all of the I don't know You don't need to know the answers.

👤 あなた [797s - 803s]
Just give me your your good thoughts as you read. And that might be enough.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [803s - 805s]
But I don't know if you're talking properly. You don't need to.

👤 あなた [805s - 817s]
No. I don't need you to know that, but I just need you to know how you're good at thinking about how this connects into real life problems, etcetera. So just give that a go.

👤 あなた [819s - 826s]
I'm doing this at a minute now. I wanna get this done ready before we go to bed and look things, and you I can't really I haven't got time for this conversation now. Of my chips.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [826s - 827s]
That's right. Mhmm.

👤 あなた [864s - 868s]
Alright. Okay. Maybe I could just copy it over.

### STT生テキスト

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [0s - 1s]
Raise. We need to go.

👤 あなた [1s - 3s]
Yeah. One sec.

👤 あなた [9s - 11s]
Yeah. I think I'm done.

👤 あなた [30s - 31s]
Say what? You have checked.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [33s - 34s]
You say?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [34s - 38s]
Yeah. I I love that. I would change it.

👤 あなた [39s - 40s]
Change what?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [40s - 48s]
We're not just learning we're not learning the gospel stuff. We're that those I think those two things have similar. They don't sound profound.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [49s - 49s]
Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [50s - 60s]
What you're saying is we're getting to know God better, the heart of God better, or we're knowing it's not just knowing our well. That's what we're doing. It sounds like we're just learning facts Oh, no.

👤 あなた [60s - 63s]
I do. I do I I do go heavy into that neck.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [63s - 73s]
Okay. But I just on that slide, I don't think those two are very contrasting in the eyes of a a simpleton. Well We're not just memorizing eighteen questions. We're learning the gospel story.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [74s - 81s]
Well, I I think learning the gospel story sounds quite similar to just learning learning a fact. Oh. Though they're both learning facts.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [82s - 84s]
Alright.

👤 あなた [84s - 86s]
We're Oh, what I meant by that is we're not just memorizing questions. We're learning the story.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [87s - 87s]
The story.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [87s - 94s]
But the problem it the problem with that is it just still does very dry. We're learning the gospel story. Sprayed it off.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [94s - 95s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [95s - 102s]
We know the gospel story. I what we're doing is we're knowing God better. We're knowing God. We're doing our faith.

👤 あなた [102s - 105s]
We're know ing our I do I do say I do say that. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [105s - 105s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [105s - 130s]
No. Of course you said that. I know. You know that. I'm just saying in those words, we're learning information about the bible.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [131s - 134s]
But what we're trying to get what we're trying to get people to come back is we're of the

👤 あなた [143s - 146s]
Well, yeah, that's my very next point I make after that slide.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [147s - 170s]
But I'm saying if you're gonna have a key point, surely that the point you want on the slide. That's the takeaway you want. You don't want people going away. We're not showing 18 questions, we're learning the gospel story. Well, there are people know that. They know the 18 questions of the gospel story, What you're saying is, you know, the the learning these 18 questions, what what what are we learning? We're learning more about is it more about goals?

👤 あなた [173s - 181s]
Is it about Babe, it's all very helpful, but I spent pretty much all day yesterday up till midnight writing it. I'm not writing it again.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [187s - 208s]
I never said that. I just said change the the line on there. You you can go on about the gospel store. You've got it at the top of the time club in this gospel store. It doesn't seem necessary to repeat that twice. And what I'm saying is that I personally coming as a person who's not you. I've not been in union. I've not been selling a degree. I don't spend all day, every day.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [211s - 232s]
Thinking You here are learning the gospel and your heart is warned by it and excited by it. Other people, it's like, well, they will sin and then who's said Jesus and then he's for it, and now we're saved. It sounds like that's what gospel story means to people.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [233s - 236s]
So so I I just don't understand that it needs to be a little bit more

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [239s - 239s]
Alright.

👤 あなた [254s - 263s]
Yeah. That's the exact next line of my script bead, but you saying I should have that in the slide. You should you saying, You're saying I should have that in my slide. Is that what you're saying?

👤 あなた [263s - 265s]
On that particular slide.

👤 あなた [268s - 270s]
For me, that's a separate slide, but okay.

👤 あなた [285s - 293s]
Now start the end of the sermon, babe, now. Well, yes, that's exactly what I got on to the very next sentence.

👤 あなた [301s - 307s]
I've got 33 slides on that power point, babe. You know, it's a valid put coming to you.

👤 あなた [317s - 330s]
It's a good point. It's a good point. It is in there that worry. It's in there. I'm thinking about the majority of the nuggets. The next thing is, well, why do we why do we need to learn the gospel story? Is it just for notch? No. It's for people in our love and joy of god and to help us in our witness.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [330s - 331s]
But that's the main that's clear visually.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [332s - 335s]
Screen.

👤 あなた [336s - 343s]
Otherwise, my takeaway when I switch off will be I feel like too I haven't gotten too much negative or constructive feedback to from you at the minute, so I just don't need any more at the minute.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [344s - 344s]
I don't is there any negative.

👤 あなた [345s - 348s]
But it's negative. Constructive. Well, you walk in a room and go, oh, no.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [348s - 351s]
Well, you can't don't do that. I'll do this.

👤 あなた [351s - 354s]
Every single time I do something, you come in and go, no. No. Do that. Do this.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [354s - 358s]
That's not me. And it's a it's a it's a I've not seen it is. Well, you are saying it.

👤 あなた [2918s - 2919s]
That seems very appealing to me, but before we had Kayla, we were

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2926s - 2927s]

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2929s - 2930s]
Well, surely the baby is the present at the end of it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2932s - 2933s]

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2944s - 2951s]

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2951s - 2952s]
But I was listening to podcasts this week about about oh, Cain who was Cain's wife?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2955s - 2966s]
Where do find it? And it was all kind of like, were there other people that were created or was it just Adam and Eve? And then they just populated from there.

👤 あなた [2968s - 2971s]
And then kind of that was the the side it went Like, Rachel getting into theological podcasting.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2972s - 2978s]
More time thinking It would say, well, if you think they were living for hundreds of years then, they would have been able to populate they would have a lot of children. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2980s - 2982s]
I think Given birth for a hundred years, how?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2988s - 2996s]
Because that would've been it would've worse then, or if we made it worse for us ourselves because life now has life has progressed. I think this has created yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2996s - 3008s]
It it gets a bit tricky, doesn't it? But I historically, if you were having kids much younger, so it just starts having which is not a thing now. So that's not me suggesting the 14 year olds should again.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [3010s - 3013s]
But if that I I I think historically, it started earlier.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3014s - 3014s]
That is true.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [3015s - 3022s]
Then actually the recovery tends to be more straightforward in your period of time that you were able to Yeah. Because, actually, even, like, teen moms and things now recover much quicker, they have much quicker labors.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3024s - 3026s]
They?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [3026s - 3028s]
