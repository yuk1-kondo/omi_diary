🎤 SPEAKER_4 [0s - 10s]
At day 11. Get some depth of the perspective. What you're looking at is an old mining town just waiting for rejuvenation.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [10s - 18s]
We're at the mine rebuilt and kick start this town's production line. There's a fair few building blocks around, but you

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [22s - 33s]
Cracking stuff, a mine that doubles as a house means the workers can sleep on the job. Quiet down. Quiet down. You hear that?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [37s - 60s]
Looks like he's seen a ghost. See if he's alright. You don't wanna go in there, pal. There's a lot of horror under the ground here. Put a decent blade my hands, and I'll turn the tables on these soulless suns and bridges and Maybe a sword, I'll make these caves safe for you.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [60s - 69s]
There's enough evil in Worm's Car as it is, an extra sword hand that you well. Get that order for a sword and slap it in the factory.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [72s - 72s]
Remember?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [73s - 83s]
Only need to design a weak weapon here. Cost some time to make should be on your mind. Now that's a worthy weapon. Come on. Let's get off with it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [84s - 92s]
Well, go on then, big hand. Come to work. Oh, who's that new mine of yours?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [113s - 133s]
Just feel the heft. Take these. First one, I reckon. I have no knack for weaponsmithing, but you clearly do. Like, time to get back in. If you wanna come in the APR, mate, you better get some armor. What you're wearing right now is no bother for a bandit blade.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [135s - 136s]
See you later, BK.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [137s - 145s]
It pays to listen to the folk that talk to you. That fella's not wrong. You don't wanna go in there without armor. Get suited up.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [152s - 156s]
Nicely done. You can get out any of your heroes in the armory.

👤 あなた [187s - 192s]
It often sits there quiet anyway. What? He often sits there quiet.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [192s - 200s]
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sometimes I pick him up from school. I just check. Do you wanna chat, or would you rather sit here quietly? Sit here quietly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [200s - 201s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [202s - 204s]
You should then chill up, sit down at me. It's just a chill.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [208s - 209s]
Oh, honey, you're working really hard.

👤 あなた [210s - 229s]
This is for tomorrow. Just wanna put some slides on it now. It's not very long. It's it's about the right length. Oh, I forgot to say. I'm I need to speak to these about this, but I'm planning to change and this will affect the order of service as such.

👤 あなた [230s - 242s]
When we do the catechisms, I wanna do the card and the song at the end of the service, not before the The reason being so what happens is you go down five minutes early and come up five minutes earlier.

👤 あなた [243s - 243s]
Instead.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [243s - 244s]
Alright.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [244s - 263s]
It's never got, unfortunately. Will. It will. If we're stripped on it. Well, unfortunately, we cannot I cannot I'm not saying no. I'm We need to have a think through it because every Sunday someone comes down and tells us service finished So we're gonna suddenly be expected to be up there within three seconds.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [263s - 277s]
When I've got 15 children in a room at halfway through their craft. I have no idea. So sometimes what I I'll do is I'll try and get them finished. Think, right, let's get them finished for 12:30. So Sometimes they're carrying on. Sometimes we have got them finished and I'm hanging on. Like, oh, you guys are not finished.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [278s - 282s]
And I'm so I don't wanna rush them because it's normally quite a problem. Like, right. That's it. No more on your craft.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [282s - 283s]
Nope.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [283s - 292s]
But six away up we go. So try and do that. This is not so much the time frame we have. It's knowing I didn't finish my initial point. There's a lot you've launched in now.

👤 あなた [295s - 302s]
You in school, you probably have a timer or something. To wrap up. So if I were my end, that's the issue, not your end.

👤 あなた [307s - 310s]
If we had a timer on my phone as well, time on yours as a five minute warning to wrap up.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [311s - 314s]
And then I have a little alarm that goes off.

👤 あなた [314s - 317s]
You have alarm that goes off. And then you can come up.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [317s - 327s]
There's also all the in the crash, though. The problem is is if they just all go, then there's no one there to pack away and whatever. Because they won't all come back down.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [329s - 331s]
Yeah. So there's all these kinds of thing.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [331s - 336s]
Like, I'm I'm not saying not to do it. Just would like to talk about a bit more because The reason I want to do it No.

👤 あなた [336s - 347s]
I I think Not just not just to mess things up for the sick of it. It's because it ruins the sermon every every single week. The whole the whole I'll tell you why.

👤 あなた [348s - 354s]
The way Pete and Me taught me is absolutely right. If there's no intrigue, if there's no interest, people switch off. They know the punchline already.

👤 あなた [355s - 367s]
Then they're not invested as much. But if you ask a question, and let it sit, and then the whole system is teasing out the answer, The way we do it in a minute is there's no teasing.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [367s - 373s]
I do I do appreciate that. You've just got to remember that half of your church leave the service. Halfway through.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [373s - 374s]
Yeah. But Okay. It's just this is fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [374s - 398s]
So, yes, that benefits you and your sermon lot, but it doesn't benefit anyone else. Because I'll have spent the whole of my no. No. No. I'm not saying I'm not saying that we're talking. No. Please, can you and our external processing? Please, can you allow some back and forth? If we're gonna do this, I need you just to I I want you to be like, oh, well, Rachel said it completely fine. We're like, yeah. Because I'm too scared to tell my husband anything. No. Look.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [398s - 400s]
Me tell you the impact and then we wave the impact.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [400s - 401s]
Yes. On. Tell me on.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [401s - 407s]
I spend the whole of kids church teaching my children a bit truth and then reversed. And we're working our way through the bible.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [408s - 428s]
I didn't have the capacity to write my own kids church planning based on catechisms, have videos for it and it like this big story is amazing. So it's slightly confused. It's it's okay if we do the catechism early, we've got all sorts of stuff that's part of ourselves, we've done our worship, we do a and then we come down. But if I'm like, we're focusing on this.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [428s - 451s]
Tell the kids take up your craft and go and tell your parents what big truth was today. And they'll go up and Daniel will go up and he's like, oh, got this. And Hannah's like, we made this. God is number one or whatever. But then we come up and we learn different truth. That is that's also something that's a little bit dry. I can see why you want it at the end, I can see why. I I think it's only favorable for those adults that are left in the sermon.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [453s - 456s]
It doesn't help the mums with babies. It doesn't help the kids.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [457s - 458s]
Of those kids' team.

👤 あなた [458s - 459s]
All of those are easily overcomable.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [460s - 462s]
The only way A person who's never served in kids' church ever.

👤 あなた [463s - 468s]
I don't need to serve in kids' church. Know, that we could fix all those issues that you just mentioned. Yeah. Easy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [468s - 469s]
Easy.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [469s - 470s]
Okay. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [470s - 472s]
The only way is patronizing.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [475s - 481s]
We can put in vigorous plan and make sure this works, Rachel. We can fix it either.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [483s - 490s]
That what I feel like that does is dismisses my point by saying what's reason I'm that is valid is to your whole thing about I'm teaching them a big truth, and then they gotta go learn another one.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [490s - 497s]
The others literally set a five minute timer. I set a five minute timer. Evan comes up, distorted. Send it. Ask people, can you go down and hop back away?

👤 あなた [497s - 498s]
Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [499s - 500s]
That's easy.

👤 あなた [500s - 501s]
It's fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [501s - 514s]
Alright. Setting a five minute time is really easy. You get your phone up. You set a five minute timer. Getting 15 children to be done by the end of that five minute timer when every now and then you won't be ready.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [514s - 520s]
And we'll be stood up and you'll be like, I I know I know I'm sorry. I'm not quite done yet. And we'll be stood upstairs.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [520s - 526s]
We'll waiting, or we'll be we we be done at time because you'll suddenly finish it up by those.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [526s - 530s]
So it's just trying to I will not think about it, and come back to me later and tell me if it's if it's impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [530s - 532s]
I'm not saying it's impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [532s - 537s]
Or not or or completely can you get used to me giving the other side of things and that's not me putting my finger on it would I don't mind that, but it seems like literally every single time it's a no

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [542s - 543s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [543s - 543s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [543s - 556s]
No. No. Honey, honey, the reason you've got leaders of different teams is that as all got different interests and and priority and understandings of those teams. Now I could just come and go, yep. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [556s - 567s]
We'll make it and then you would have no idea the amount or impact of it has. Please at least let me share it. So where you're like, we're gonna do it end of it. You didn't think about doing those things, did you?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [567s - 576s]
And so I'm just letting you know what those things are. We can do whatever needs to be done. But it will make life like, kids church has been going really well.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [577s - 596s]
It's quite hard getting them out of time. I really really really try every week to get up for that last song, but it's a it's erratic when we get told because eve because what happens is someone comes up and tells us when the sermon's finished. By the time they come down and they tell us, they were like, oh, okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [596s - 615s]
Right. Okay. Stripe and tell you normal. Right. Cool kids. Have a fish. And I wanna get my helpers up for the end of worship time and get up and the kids finish with a worship song and me be up there for it. But it's so erratic, the end point. Yeah. Like, and I know it seems to, make sense, but two minutes of, oh, we're still not ready.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [615s - 623s]
Sorry. Or two minutes of we're ready and we're hanging around and your guys ready. It's actually quite hard work with children. So it's just what will happen if we're not there

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [627s - 629s]
Oh, I'd have to wait for you, basically. It's cool.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [633s - 643s]
Essentially, And I can make the timing work. It's just a little bit of a it feels pointless, like, just don't do it with the kids, the catechism, which obviously is then pointless us and sad. Oh, no.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [645s - 648s]
It's just we spend our session stuff, and I the whole point can be So no matter what order we do it, and then you've got the same problem It is a bit of a clash.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [648s - 651s]
Yes. But when it goes immediately from one to the other It's okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [652s - 654s]
Of learning more than two truths in a day.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [654s - 654s]
No. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [654s - 655s]
I get that.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [656s - 667s]
But when it's so directly close, know, what doing is I'm trying to send the kids up this and to explain to their parents, go give the sheet, take Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [667s - 669s]
Understand.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [669s - 678s]
It just ruins it flattens the whole blinking thing. That's the problem. I think people would be a lot more engaged. If I didn't have to run the punchline before I even preach it every Sunday.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [678s - 681s]
So we can put the question front on the board, just not turn it over.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [682s - 687s]
Yeah. And Bob, what about the song? I mean, it's not just for adults. It's meant to be for the whole church.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [687s - 691s]
Does that mean there's no mini time anymore and no worship time at the end of the service?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [691s - 695s]
People are not responding to the blinking ministry. The nobody's come down for prayer for the last two months.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [695s - 697s]
Debbie told me it's her favorite part of the service.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [697s - 700s]
Yeah. Months ago when we first did it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [701s - 705s]
She hasn't responded at all, and I've made a baby don't need to respond by walking up, honey.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [707s - 709s]
People respond in their It's a chance just to Well, the song the song in itself is kind of a response really.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [711s - 719s]
A response in a someone who's not even a Christian can enjoy it. Respond way rather than a real serious pause and rest and infilling for the week.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [720s - 736s]
That's all. Right. Leaving a service with the truth of Jesus was fully human and fully man because of this is the same as and I will give my life trust in you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [736s - 737s]
I will put my trust in you alone.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [737s - 747s]
You my firm foundation, and that's your last truth. That you're singing. It's just it's just in some worship or I don't know. And, like, you know, just being able to have a pause of the person next to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [747s - 748s]
Are you okay?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [748s - 759s]
I would I it's not it's not absolutely completely hundred percent necessary, but I would very much like not to ruin my sooner.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [759s - 759s]
I guess it.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [759s - 760s]
I get it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [760s - 765s]
It ruins every week, every time. What I would say thought it was a simple change.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [766s - 780s]
I think it's a shame not to end moving one segment from the middle to the end But you're cutting out the only really opportunity for adults to really engage. There's no children around particularly, not especially not for the first song.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [780s - 794s]
It's just a bit of reflection and just something a bit more gentle because the kids are in for all the worship and then and you're removing that just because people haven't come up to the front. But it does lose the atmosphere of can I pray for you at the end?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [794s - 805s]
Or if someone is just having a bit of, they bit of time then when the kids are not there. You're getting rid of that now and we're just going high energy for the whole service.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [806s - 818s]
Maybe one little slow song, but by that point the kids are struggling a little bit. I understand we want to The only thing I would say is you're all about repetition.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [820s - 841s]
And I also think some of these things are quite complicated. I think I don't think it's a do you you either want people to be enjoying your sermon or you want people to go away with the truth? And I think by having question and then the talk unpacking it and then like with the song that and people going away. Think it sinks in more. Think but but I'm not their concern.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [841s - 861s]
So I don't know if people have sat there bored. I think maybe they're bored because the concept of it is quite intellect and quite complicated perhaps. It's not very engaging topic in some ways although it is but only for people that want to know. I I don't think I I understand what you're saying I'll never think about what PG's me me have a little let me have like the second school.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [861s - 868s]
Let me look the last comment, please. In school. No. No. No. This is important teaching thing. In school, we are told, don't keep anything sequenced.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [868s - 888s]
What you do is you pre prepare. So for the low ability, what you do is you pre prepare them. So before you're going to do this exciting thing, you actually read the stories three times before. It's the first time you read it to the class. It's really exciting. The lower ability needs to read it to them three times before, which you think would be a spoiler but actually they need that because it they they don't they can't take it in first.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [888s - 889s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [889s - 889s]
Understand what you're saying.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [889s - 892s]
They may well have a question and answer catechism question. And answer.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [895s - 908s]
Alright. Babe, babe, babe, I feel like you took my head off a little bit now. Just need to have a little think. There's other ways I can deal with it. I can can just ask a second question of the catechism question itself and then answer that one.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [908s - 909s]
Yeah. Maybe.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [910s - 914s]
How does this apply? What does this mean for you or something really boring like that?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [915s - 915s]
Well, no.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [915s - 917s]
That's not boring. That's an the whole point.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [917s - 917s]
Well, not really.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [917s - 920s]
It's very human centric preaching. I don't like it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [922s - 922s]
Well, fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [922s - 923s]
It's all about me and how it applies to my wife.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [923s - 926s]
About no. Rather than oh, god.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [926s - 937s]
Gospel is about God, but how it impacts us. If it was not related to us, then the story wouldn't include us. But the whole point is it does. You have to say, so why does this It does.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [937s - 944s]
I know it does. I know we have to include that in preaching, but it's not the I don't need to be the main but that's human centered preaching rather than Christ preaching.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [944s - 954s]
No. No. No. No. Not if you're doing the Christ centered, but bringing in our into that because the whole point is relationship. Why would you spend your whole time talking about Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [956s - 958s]
I understand what you said. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [958s - 959s]
I love it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [959s - 965s]
Babe, I bet I'm sorry, but you've done 90% of the talking in you've it's not a it's not a conversation.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [966s - 969s]
It's you expending words to convince me. Sorry. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [969s - 970s]
No. No. No. Yeah. I'm not annoying.

👤 あなた [971s - 972s]
I just don't wanna talk about it now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [973s - 977s]
But if you came I didn't realize I was triggering a whole blinking ten fifty minute conversation. When you Not a conversation.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [977s - 979s]
Ten fifty minute dialogue at me.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [979s - 981s]
Let let me start it. I don't want it.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [981s - 982s]
I would didn't want to I'm not talking about this now.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [982s - 989s]
I'm saying two different things. You come and say, Rachel, I'm thinking about changing this to this. No. I'm gonna get them having a meeting together.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [989s - 1014s]
With the service leaders because we're doing this. Already decided it. If you came and said, what do you think about that? I I I really need to do this thinking about putting it at the end. But in your head, you've already created a new order of service. You're printing it out. You're telling the ministry leaders, you're jumping ahead on it. So now you're really annoyed because in your head, this is what's happening. I've planned out the whole year. You need to get to point before that. It doesn't work with team. It doesn't work. And then what happens is I have to come here.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1014s - 1015s]
I'm not worried about that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1015s - 1025s]
That. It's the the sheer amount of words that you're speaking at me. Before I can even reply. I don't need all that. You've said your piece. That was enough.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1025s - 1030s]
I don't need I wasn't saying my piece. Was trying to help you understand. So when I was coming in and saying about the pre read, I I would love to make sure I'm know that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1031s - 1037s]
In my head, I was in middle of doing this task, and so that's probably part of my why I'm getting frustrated. Because it's suddenly becoming a full on.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1037s - 1046s]
It's fine. But you told me when changing this. I'm telling the ministry leaders. So it makes me a bit more like oh, panic as in Yes. Well, I need to tell you why what? There's no dialogue on this?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1046s - 1050s]
What? You can't just decide stuff and not talk to anyone.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1052s - 1053s]
