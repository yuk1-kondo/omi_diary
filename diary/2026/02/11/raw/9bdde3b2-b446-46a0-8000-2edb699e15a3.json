    "title": "Driving Blind Spots Explained During Lesson",
    "overview": "The user appears to be instructing a learner about driving blind spots. They explain that areas not visible in mirrors or through the window are called blind spots, using a lamppost and an imagined person with a pushchair as examples. The instructor demonstrates how leaning changes visibility and emphasizes checking over the shoulder rather than relying solely on mirrors. After the explanation, the user says they will start listening to the audiobook 'Mistborn', chapter four, and asks to study a newcomer (likely a character in the book).",
