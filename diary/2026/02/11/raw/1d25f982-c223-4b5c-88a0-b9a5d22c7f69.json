    "title": "Crew Agrees To Overthrow The Final Empire",
    "overview": "This scene captures a pivotal underworld meeting where Kelsier reveals to his thieving crew that their new employer is Yeden, a ska rebellion leader. The group — including Kelsier, Yeden, Breeze, Ham, Dockson, Clubs, and Vin — learns that the job is not a typical heist but a radical plan to help Yeden overthrow the Final Empire, seize Luthadel, and rob the Lord Ruler’s vast atium treasury. Tension rises as they debate the feasibility, cost, and risks of neutralizing the city garrison, throwing Luthadel into chaos, outmaneuvering the Steel Ministry and its Inquisitors, and ensuring Yeden can hold power afterward. Kelsier argues that a small, expert allomancer crew is better suited to succeed than traditional scattered rebellions, framing the operation as both lucrative and morally significant for the ska. The promise of access to the Lord Ruler’s atium stockpile finally tempts Breeze and Ham to commit, despite Clubs’ vehement opposition and departure. Kelsier then unveils an even bolder personal objective: he intends to kill the supposedly immortal Lord Ruler using a mysterious “eleventh metal” bar, a substance from the North he believes to be the tyrant’s weakness. The crew is skeptical but intrigued. Vin, a new recruit and secretly another Mistborn, chooses to join despite believing Kelsier may be insane, driven by her desire to learn allomancy. The excerpt closes with an external, more ominous reflection about a separate duty to destroy the “deepness,” hinting at a larger, world-threatening danger beyond this conspiracy.",
