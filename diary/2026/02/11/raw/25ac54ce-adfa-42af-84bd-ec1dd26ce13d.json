    "title": "Debugging Player Respawn Base-Zone Collision",
    "overview": "A developer raises a concern about a possible edge-case bug: when the player is destroyed, body parts are propelled far away, and a stray body part might contact the base zone collider. They wonder if this could cause the game to incorrectly register the respawned player as already being at the base when picking up a brain rot power-up, leading to unintended behavior.",
