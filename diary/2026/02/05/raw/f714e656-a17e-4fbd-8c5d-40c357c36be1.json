    "title": "Discussion Of FBI Civil Rights Investigation",
    "overview": "The speaker describes a man named Alex Pretty as someone who arrived at an ICE protest with ill intent. They are questioned about whether they would apologize if it were later determined that the man's civil rights were violated by an FBI investigation. The speaker repeatedly avoids committing to a hypothetical apology, emphasizing instead that they will wait for the investigation to conclude and apologizing only for being misunderstood.",
