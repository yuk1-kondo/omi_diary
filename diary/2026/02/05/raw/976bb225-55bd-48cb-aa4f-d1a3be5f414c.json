    "title": "Courtroom Dialogue On Counsel Application",
    "overview": "The content captures a brief, fragmented courtroom-style exchange. One speaker, likely a judge, questions a party or counsel about an application and notes that important information was not disclosed when the application was filed. The judge points out that the person has previously appeared and testified verbally before the court and has visited the clerk's office to speak in person. Another voice reacts with surprise or exasperation, suggesting some confusion or tension about whether the person is properly recognized as counsel or about the procedural handling of their application.",
