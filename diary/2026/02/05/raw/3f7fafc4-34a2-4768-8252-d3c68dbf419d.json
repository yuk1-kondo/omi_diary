    "title": "Sci-Fi Bridge Scene Draft Review",
    "overview": "The content is a narrative draft in a science-fiction setting, not a real conversation. A character reflects on wearing a mentor’s old coat, associated with guilt over a failed mission where forty people died. The scene includes rich sensory details (gold piping, tobacco scent, heavy fabric) and emotional tension around failure, responsibility, and marriage. The protagonist interacts with Eris, head of xenology and also their wife, who questions whether they seek guidance from an old report or trying to understand how to handle an upcoming trial. Another character, likely a subordinate, interrupts to say the bridge is waiting and remarks that someone named Vane is already pacing on the tactical floor. The dialogue explores themes of leadership, self-doubt, and the weight of command.",
