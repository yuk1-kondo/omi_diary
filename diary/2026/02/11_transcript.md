## 📝 Crew Agrees To Overthrow The Final Empire - 1d25f982-c223-4b5c-88a0-b9a5d22c7f69

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [0s - 12s]
I had to admit that she had never seen any poetry welcomed so happily by his men. Ah, Calcio sat toward the other side of the room. Clubs are evil too.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [15s - 24s]
So ever I absolutely though. Being able to break break five hours. Yeah. And so back into their chairs, Dachshund taking a seat at the same table.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [25s - 28s]
Are we to receive any explanation for your tardiness?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [37s - 50s]
Against the bar, scanning the room. When Calcior's eyes fell on Vin, he winked. Your brother, Ham said, Is Morse coming to the meeting? Kelsey and Daxson shared a look.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [52s - 65s]
Not tonight, Kelsey said. But he'll join the crew eventually. Vin studied the others. They were skeptical. Tension between Causir and his brother perhaps?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [66s - 75s]
Breeze raised his dueling cane, pointing the tip at Calcira. All right, Calciere. You have kept this secret from us for eight months now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [76s - 85s]
We know it's big. We know you're excited, and we're all properly annoyed at you for being so secretive. So why don't you just go ahead and tell us what it is?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [86s - 96s]
Calcio smiled. Then he stood up straight, waving a hand toward the dirty plain looking Eden. Gentlemen, meet your new employer.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [98s - 111s]
This was apparently quite a shocking statement. Him? Ham asked. Him? Kelsior said with an awed. What? Eden asked, speaking for the first time.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [112s - 122s]
You have trouble working with someone who actually has morals. It's not that, my dear man. Breeze said, setting his jeweling cane across his lap.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [122s - 133s]
It's just that. Well, I was under the stringer impression that you didn't like our types very much. I don't, Eden said flatly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [133s - 141s]
You're selfish, undisciplined, and you've turned your backs on the rest of the scar. You dress nicely, but on the inside, you're dirty as ash.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [142s - 157s]
Ham snorted. I can see already that this job is going to be great for crew morale. Then washed quietly, chewing on her lip. Was obviously a ska worker, probably a member of a forge or textile mill.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [158s - 168s]
What connection did he have with the underground? And how would he be able to afford the services of a thieving crew? Especially one as apparently specialized as Kelsier's team?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [169s - 178s]
Perhaps Kelsier noticed her confusion, for she found him looking at hers the others continued to speak. I'm still a little confused, Pam said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [179s - 193s]
Eden, we're all aware of how you regard Thieves. So why hire us? Eden squirmed a bit. Because, he finally said, everyone knows how effective you are.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [194s - 210s]
Breeze chuckled. Disapproving of our morals doesn't make you unwilling to make you of our skills, I see. So what is the job then? Or does the scar rebellion Scar Rebellion? Ben thought.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [211s - 220s]
A piece of the conversation falling into place. There were two sides to the underworld, the far larger portion was made up of the thieves, crews, whores, and beggars.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [221s - 229s]
Tried to survive outside of mainstream ska culture. And then there were the rebels. The people who worked against the final empire.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [230s - 244s]
Reen had always called them fools, a sentiment shared by most of the people, both underworlders and ska, that Vin had met. All eyes slowly turned to Celsier, who leaned back against the bar again.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [246s - 257s]
The Scar Rebellion, courtesy of its leader Yigen, has hired us for something very specific. What? Ham asked. Robbery? Assassination?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [258s - 272s]
A little of both, Kelsier said. And at the same time, neither one. Gentlemen, this isn't going to be a regular job. It's going to be different from anything, any crew has ever tried to pull.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [272s - 289s]
We're going to help Eaton overthrow the final empire. Silence. Excuse me? Ham asked. You heard me right, Ham, Kelseo said. That's the job I've been planning.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [290s - 303s]
The destruction of the final empire. Or at least its center of government. Eden has hired us to supply him with an army then provide him with a favorable opportunity to seize control of the city.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [304s - 307s]
Ham sat back, then shared a glance with Breeze.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [308s - 319s]
Both men turned toward Dachshund who nodded solemnly. The room remained quiet for a moment longer. Then the silence was broken as Eden began to laugh ruefully to himself.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [320s - 337s]
And I should never have to this. Eden said, shaking his head. Now that you say it, I realize how ridiculous it all sounds. Trust me, Eden, Kelcio said. These men have made a habit of pulling off plans that seemed ridiculous at first glance.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [339s - 344s]
That may be true, Cal, Bree said. But in this case, I find my

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [347s - 360s]
Overthrow the final empire. That is something that ska rebels have been working toward for a thousand years. What makes you think that we can achieve anything that those men have failed? Kelsey smiled.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [362s - 365s]
We'll succeed because we have vision, breeze.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [370s - 398s]
Yeden said indignantly. It's true, unfortunately, Kelsey said. The rebellion condemns people like us because of our greed. But for all their high morals, which, by the way, I respect, they never get anything done. Eden your men hide in woods and in hills, laughing how they'll someday rise up and meet a your kind has no idea how to develop and execute a proper plan.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [399s - 413s]
Eden's expression grew dark. And you have no idea what you are talking about. Oh? Said lightly. Tell me, has your rebellion accomplished during its thousand year struggle?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [414s - 422s]
Where are your successes and your victories? The massacre of Duger three centuries ago, where 7,000 scar rebels were slaughtered.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [422s - 432s]
The occasional rate of a traveling canal boat, or the kidnap of a minor and noble official. Eden flashed. That's the best we can manage with the people we have.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [433s - 443s]
Don't blame my men for their failures. Blame the rest of the scar. We can't ever get them to help. They've been beaten down for a millennium. They haven't got any spirit left.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [444s - 452s]
It's difficult enough to get one in a thousand to listen to us, let alone rebel. Peace, Eden, Chelsea said, holding up a hand.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [453s - 462s]
I'm not trying to insult your courage. We're on the same side. Remember? You came to me specifically because you were having trouble recruiting people for your army.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [463s - 475s]
I'm regretting that decision more and more, a thief. Said. Well, already paid us, Calcio said. So it's a little late to back out now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [475s - 483s]
But we'll get you that army, Eden. The men in this room are the most capable, most clever, and most skilled alamancers in the

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [486s - 500s]
The room grew quiet again. Vin sat at her table watching the interaction with a frown. What is your game, Kelsier? His words about overthrowing the final empire were obviously a front.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [501s - 510s]
It seemed most likely to her that he intended to scam the ska rebellion. But if he'd already been paid, then why continue the charade?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [512s - 522s]
Kelsier turned from Eden to breezed ham. Alright, gentlemen. What do you think? The two men shared a look. Finally, Breeze spoke.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [524s - 533s]
Lord Ruler knows I had never been one to turn down a challenge. But Kel, I do question your reasoning. Are you sure we can do this?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [534s - 543s]
I'm positive, Kelsier said. Previous attempts to overthrow the lord ruler have failed, but they lacked proper organization and planning.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [544s - 559s]
We're thieves, gentlemen, and we're extraordinarily good ones. We can rob the unrobbable and fool the unfoolable. We know how to take an incredibly large task and break it down to manageable pieces, then with each of those pieces.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [559s - 573s]
We know how to get what we want. These things make us perfect for this particular task. Breeze frowned. And how much are we getting paid for achieving the impossible?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [574s - 589s]
30,000 boxings, Eden said. Half now, half when you deliver the army. 30,000, Pam said, for an operation this big that will barely cover expenses.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [590s - 597s]
We'll need a spy among an ability to watch for rumors. We'll need a couple of safe houses, not to mention some place big enough to hide and train an entire army.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [598s - 608s]
No use haggling now, safe, Eden snapped. 30,000 may not sound like much to your type. It's the result of decades of saving on our part.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [608s - 617s]
We can't pay you more because we don't have anything more. It's good work, gentlemen, Dachshund noted, joining the conversation for the first time.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [618s - 631s]
Yes. Well, that's all great, briefed said. I consider myself a nice enough fellow. But this just seems a bit too altruistic. Not to mention stupid.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [632s - 645s]
Well, Calcius said, there might be a little bit more in it for us. Vin perked up, and Breeze smiled. The lord ruler's treasury, Kelseyor said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [646s - 657s]
The plan, as it stands now, is to provide with an army, an opportunity to seize the city. Once he takes the palace, he'll capture the treasury and use its funds to secure power.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [658s - 676s]
And central to that treasury, is the lord ruler's atrium. Breeze said. Kelsier nodded. Our agreement with Aden provides us of the ATIM reserves we find in the palace, no matter how vast they may be.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [678s - 690s]
Atium. Then it heard of the metal, but she never actually seen any. It was incredibly rare, supposedly used only by noblemen. Ham was smiling.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [691s - 703s]
Well, no, he said slowly. That's almost a big enough price to be tempting. That ATM stockpile is supposed to be enormous. Calcio said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [704s - 714s]
The Lord Ruler sells the metal only in small bits. Charging outrageous sums to the nobility. He has to keep a huge reserve of it to make certain he controls the market.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [715s - 726s]
To make certain he has enough wealth for emergencies. True, Breeze said. But are you sure you want to try something like this so soon after what

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [730s - 739s]
We're going to do things differently this time, Kelsey said. Gentlemen, be frank with you. This isn't going to be an easy job.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [740s - 749s]
But it can work. The plan is simple. We're going to find a way to neutralize the Luther Dell garrison. Leaving the area without a policing force.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [750s - 759s]
We're going to throw the city into chaos. We've got a couple of options on how to do that, Dachshund said. But we can talk about that later. Kelsior nodded.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [760s - 776s]
Then in that chaos, Eden will march his army into and seize the palace, taking the lord ruler prisoner. While Yiden secures the city, we'll pilfer the Atium. We'll give half to him, then disappear with the other half.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [777s - 789s]
After that, it's his job to hang on to what he's grabbed. Sounds a little dangerous for you, Eden. Ham noted, glancing at the rebel leader. He shrugged.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [789s - 799s]
Perhaps But if we do, by some miracle, end up in control of the then we'll have at least done something no ska rebellion has ever achieved before.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [800s - 811s]
For my men, this isn't just about riches. It isn't even about surviving. It's about doing something grand, wonderful to give the ska a hope.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [812s - 820s]
But I don't expect you people to understand things like that. Elsie shot a quieting glance at Eden, and the man sniffed and sat back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [822s - 831s]
Did he use alomancy? Then wondered She'd seen employer crew relationships before. It seemed that Eden was much more in Calcior's pocket than the other way around.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [833s - 846s]
Calcior turned back to Hammond Breeze. There's more to all this than simply a show of daring. If we manage to steal that atrium, it will be a sound blow to the Lord Ruler's financial foundation.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [846s - 862s]
He depends on the money that ATM provides. Without it, could very well be left without the means to pay his armies. Even if he escapes our trap or if we decide to take the city when he's gone to minimize having to deal with him, he'll be financially ruined.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [863s - 874s]
Won't be able to march soldiers in to take the city away from Eden. If this works right, we'll have the city in chaos anyway, and an ability will be too weak to react against the rebel forces.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [874s - 893s]
The lord ruler will be left confused and unable to mount a sizable army. And the coloss Hem asked quietly. Kelsier paused. If he marches those creatures on his own capital city, the destruction it would cause, could be even more dangerous than financial instability.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [894s - 902s]
In the chaos, the provincial nobleman will rebel and themselves up as kings. The lord ruler won't have the troops to bring him into line.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [902s - 915s]
Eden's rebels will be able to hold Lithadal and we, my friends. Will be very, very rich. Everyone gets what they want. You're forgetting the steel ministry.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [916s - 925s]
Clubs snapped, sitting almost forgotten at the side of the room. Those inquisitors won't just let us throw their petty into chaos.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [927s - 935s]
Kelcia paused, turning toward the gnarled man. We will have to find a way to deal with the ministry. I've got a few plans for that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [936s - 946s]
Either way, problems like that are the things that we as a crew will have to work out. We have to get rid of the lithodil garrison. There's no way we'll be able to get anything done with them.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [946s - 954s]
Policing the streets. We'll have to come up with an appropriate way to throw the city into chaos. And we'll have to find a way to keep the obligators off our trail.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [955s - 964s]
But if we play this right, we might be able to force the lord ruler to send the palace guard. Maybe even the inquisitors into the city to restore order.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [964s - 973s]
That will leave the palace itself exposed giving Eden a perfect opportunity to strike. After that, it won't matter what happens with the ministry or the garrison.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [974s - 985s]
The Lord Ruler won't have the money to maintain control of his empire. I don't know, Cal, Bree said. Shaking his head. His flippancy was subdued.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [985s - 994s]
Seemed to be honestly considering the plan. The lord ruler got that at him somewhere. What if he just goes in mine some more?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [995s - 1006s]
Ham nodded. No one even knows where the Atrium mine is. I wouldn't say no one. Said with a smile. Breeze and Ham shared a look.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1007s - 1021s]
You know? Ham asked. Of course, Kelsey said. I spent a year of my life working there. The pits? Am asked with surprise. Kelsior nodded.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1022s - 1026s]
That's why the lord ruler makes certain nobody survives working there.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1029s - 1045s]
It's not just a penal colony, not just a hellhole where scars sent to die. It's a mine. Of course, Breeze said. Kelsey stood up straight, stepping away from the bar and walking him and Breeze's table.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1046s - 1057s]
We have a chance here, gentlemen. Chance to do something great. Something no other thieving crew has ever done. We'll rob from the lord ruler himself.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1058s - 1070s]
But there's more. The pits nearly killed me. And I've seen things differently since I escaped. I see the ska working without hope.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1070s - 1078s]
I see the thieving crews trying to survive an aristocratic leavings. Often getting themselves and other ska killed in the process.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1079s - 1088s]
I see the ska rebellion trying so hard to resist the lord ruler and never may any progress. The rebellion fails because it's too unwieldy and spread out.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1089s - 1096s]
Anytime one of its many pieces gains momentum, the steel ministry crushes it. That's not the way to defeat the final empire, gentlemen.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1097s - 1112s]
But a small team specialized and skilled, has a hope. We can work without great risk of exposure. We know how to avoid the steel ministry's tendrils. We understand how the high nobility think and how to exploit its members.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1114s - 1126s]
We can do this. He paused beside Breeze and Ham's table. I know, Kel, Ham said. It's not that I'm disagreeing with your motives.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1127s - 1138s]
It's just that well, this seems a bit foolhardy. Kelsier smiled. I know it does. But you're going to go along with it anyway, aren't you?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1139s - 1149s]
Pam paused, then nodded. You know, I'll join your crew no matter what the job. This sounds crazy, but so do most of your plans.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1150s - 1161s]
Just just tell me. Are you serious about overthrowing the Lord Ruler? Kelsey nodded. For some reason, Ben was almost tempted to believe him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1162s - 1177s]
Ham nodded firmly. Alright then. I'm in. Breeze, Kelsira asked. The well dressed man shook his head. I'm not sure, Cal. This is a bit extreme.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1177s - 1199s]
Even for you. We need you, Breeze, Cal said. No one can sue the crowd like you can. If we're going to raise an army, we'll need your alamancers and your powers. Well, that much is true, Bree said. But even still, Calcior smiled, then he said something on the table.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1200s - 1209s]
The cup of wine Vin had poured for Breeze. She hadn't even noticed that Kelsier had it off of the bar. Think of the challenge breeze.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1209s - 1222s]
Said. Breeze glanced at the cup, then looked up at Finally, he laughed, reaching for the wine. Fine. I'm in. It's impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1223s - 1232s]
A gruff voice said from the back of the room. Clubs sat with folded arms regarding Kelsier with a scowl. What are you really planning, Kelsier?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1234s - 1246s]
I'm being honest, Celsier I plan to take the lord ruler's atrium and overthrow his empire. You can't, the man said. It's idiocy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1246s - 1261s]
The inquisitors will hang us all by hooks through our throats. Perhaps, Calcior said. But think of the reward if we succeed. Well, power, and a land where the scar can live like men.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1262s - 1273s]
Rather than slaves. Clubs snorted loudly. Then he stood, his chair toppling backward onto the floor behind him. No reward would be enough.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1274s - 1288s]
The lord ruler tried to have you killed once. I see that you won't be satisfied until he gets it right. With that, the older man turned and stopped in a limping gate from the room, slamming the door behind him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1289s - 1301s]
The lair grew quiet. Well, guess we need a different smoker, docks said. You're just going to let him go? You demand He knows everything.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1302s - 1311s]
Breeze chuckled. Aren't you supposed to be the moral one in this little group? Morals doesn't have anything to do with it, Eaton said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1311s - 1320s]
Letting someone go like that is foolish. He could bring the obligators down on us in minutes. Vin nodded in agreement, but Kelsier just shook his head.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1322s - 1335s]
I work that way, Eden. I invited clubs to a meeting where I outlined a dangerous plan. One some people might even call I'm not going to have him assassinated because he decided it was too dangerous.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1335s - 1347s]
If you do things like that, pretty soon nobody will come listen to your plans in the first place. Besides, Dachshund said, we wouldn't invite someone to one of these meetings unless we trusted him not to betray us.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1348s - 1372s]
Impossible, Ben thought from him. He had to be fluffing to keep up crew morale. Nobody was that trusting him. After all, having the others said that Jelsier's failure to review before the event that had sent him to the Pits Of Hathseny had come because of a betrayal He probably had assassin's father with the roadstick bearing moment, him make certain he didn't go to the authorities.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1374s - 1386s]
All right here, Kelsey has said, getting back to business. They accepted. The plan is on. Are you still in? Will you give the rebellions money back if I say no?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1386s - 1402s]
Eden asked. The only response to that was a quiet chuckle from Ham. Eaton's expression darkened, but he just shook his head. If I had any other option, Oh, stop complaining, Kelsey or said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1402s - 1415s]
You're officially part of a thieving crew now, so you might as well come over here and sit with us. Eden paused for a moment, then sighed and walked over to sit at ham, and dachshund's table beside which Elsayer was still standing.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1416s - 1431s]
Ben still sat at the next table over. Kelsey returned, looking over toward Ben. What about you, Ben? She paused. Why is he asking me? He already knows he has a hold over me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1431s - 1442s]
The job doesn't matter as long as I learn what he knows. Kelsey are waited expectantly. I'm in, Vince said, assuming that was he wanted to hear.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1443s - 1455s]
She must have guessed correctly, for Calciere smiled. Then nodded to the last chair at the table. Vin sighed, but did as he indicated, standing and walking over to take the last seat.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1456s - 1472s]
Who is the child? Eden asked. Twixt, Breeze said. Cassie cocked an eyebrow. Actually, Vin is something of a new recruit. My brother caught her soothing his emotions a few months back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1474s - 1485s]
Surgery? M asked. Guess we can always use another of those. Actually, Calcior noted, it seems she can riot people's emotions as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1487s - 1503s]
Started. Really? Ham asked. Kelceer nodded. Dunks and I tested her just a few hours ago. Brace chuckled. And here I was telling her that she'd probably never meet her mistborn beside yourself.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1505s - 1516s]
A second mistborn on the team, Am said appreciatively. Well, that increases our chances somewhat. What are you saying? Eaton spired.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1516s - 1527s]
Skye can't be mistborn. I'm not even sure if Mistborn exist. I've certainly never met one. Freeze raised an eyebrow. Lay the hand on hidden shoulder.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1528s - 1544s]
You should try not to talk so much, friend, he suggested You'll sound far less stupid that way. Shook off Brace's hand, and Han laughed. Then however, sat quietly considering the implications of what Kelsier had said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1545s - 1560s]
The part about stealing the ATIM reserves was tempting, but seizing the city to do it. Were these men really that reckless? Calcior pulled a chair over to the table for himself and down on it the wrong way, resting his arms on the seat back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1561s - 1573s]
Alright, he said. We have a crew. We'll plan specifics at the next meeting. But I want you all to be thinking about the job. I have plans, but I want fresh minds to consider our task.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1574s - 1582s]
Need to discuss ways to get the Lutherdale garrison out of the city. Ways that we can throw this place into so much chaos that the greenhouses can't mobilize their forces.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1582s - 1592s]
To stop Yidan's army when it attacks. Remember, of the group, say Eaton, nodded. Before we end for the evening, however, Kelsey continued.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1593s - 1607s]
There is one more part of the plan I want to warn you about. More? Bruce asked with a chuckle. Stealing the Lord Ruler's fortune and overthrowing his empire are enough. Calcio said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1608s - 1630s]
If I can, I'm going to kill him too. Silence. Kelsey, Ham said slowly. The lord ruler is the sliver of infinity. He's a piece of God himself. You can't kill him. Even capturing him will probably prove impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1631s - 1644s]
Kelsier didn't reply. His eyes, however, were determined. That's it, Vin thought. He has to be insane. The lord ruler and I, Calcio said, quietly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1645s - 1657s]
We have an unsettled debt. He took mare from me, and he nearly took my own sanity as well. I'll admit to you all that part of my reason for this plan is to get revenge on him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1658s - 1665s]
We're going to take his government, his home, and his fortune from him. However, for that to work, we'll have to get rid of him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1665s - 1675s]
Perhaps imprison him in his own dungeons. At the very least, we'll have to get him out of the city. However, I can think of something far better than either option.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1676s - 1685s]
Down those pits where he sent me, I snapped and came to an awakening of my elemantic powers. Now I intend to use them to kill him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1687s - 1697s]
Calcia reached into his suit pocket and pulled something out. He set it on the table. In the North, they have a Calcior said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1698s - 1708s]
It teaches that the lord ruler isn't immortal. Not completely. They say he can be killed with the right metal. The eleventh medal.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1709s - 1725s]
That medal, Eyes turned toward the object on the table. It was a thin bar of metal, perhaps as long and wide as Vin's small with straight sides. It was so silvery white in color.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1726s - 1741s]
The eleventh metal breeze asked uncertainly. I've heard of no such legend. The Lord Ruler has it, Calcior said. But it can still be found if you know where to look.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1742s - 1755s]
Alomantic theory teaches of 10 medals, the eight basic medals, and the two high medals. There is another one, however, unknown to most, one far more powerful even than the other 10.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1756s - 1767s]
Breeze frowned skeptically. Eden, however, appeared intrigued. And this metal can somehow kill the lord ruler? Kelsior nodded.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1768s - 1777s]
It's his weakness. The steel ministry wants you to believe that he's immortal, even he can be killed by an alamance of running this.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1779s - 1792s]
Ham reached out, picking up the thin bar of metal. Where did you get it? In the North, Kelceo said. In a land near the Far Peninsula, a land where people still remember

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1797s - 1810s]
How does it work? Breeze asked. I'm not sure, Calcior said frankly. But I intend to find out. Em regarded the porcelain colored metal turning it over his fingers.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1811s - 1822s]
Kill the lord ruler, Ben thought. The lord ruler was a force like the winds of the mists. One did kill such things. They didn't live, really.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1823s - 1840s]
They simply were. Regardless, Calcior said, accepting the little back from him, You don't need to worry about this. Killing the lord ruler is my task. If it proves impossible, we'll settle for tricking him outside the city, then rob him silly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1841s - 1855s]
I just thought you should know what I'm planning. I've bound myself to a mad man, Ben thought But that didn't really matter. Not as long as he taught her alomancy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1858s - 1868s]
I don't even understand what I'm The terrorist philosophers claim that I'll know my duty when the time comes. But that's a small comfort.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1869s - 1883s]
The deepness must be destroyed. And apparently, I'm the only one who can do so. It ravages the world even now. If I don't stop it soon, there will be nothing left of this land but bones and dust.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1887s - 1890s]
Five Uh-huh.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [241s - 244s]
Every choice you make here, it goes across Artemis.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [332s - 333s]
Don't kill me.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [333s - 334s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [372s - 376s]
I don't have nothing, man. I don't I don't have a gun in there.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [443s - 445s]
Well, Every choice you make here, I washed my hands in concrete.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [451s - 455s]
I went through with diesel. You wash those with dovetail. We're not the same.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [455s - 460s]
I'll brush my teeth with brake fluid and wipe my ass with We are not gonna sign.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [460s - 464s]
I did nails for breakfast this morning.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [568s - 576s]
Without human beings, possible contact with extra possible human immortality, appalling acts of brutality, genocide, because these systems which are in place to keep the going on is the breakdown of all traditional at?

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [664s - 667s]
Where the money at? I see what you posted on Facebook. Where the money at?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [669s - 671s]
Anthony says two days before the attempted robbery, someone called him broke on social media, so he posted this picture of a stack of cash from an old Facebook memory only to find himself explaining to his attacker that it wasn't his money.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [683s - 688s]
At I said, man, it was a prank. It was fake.

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [689s - 703s]
When the intruders realized there wasn't a pile of cash hidden inside the home here on Patricia Street, didn't just leave. Instead, after repeatedly pistol whipping and choking in, one of the suspects shot an execution style in the back of the neck.

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [703s - 706s]
He just dug the thumb straight to the back of my head and pulled the tree.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [708s - 715s]
I believe. You know, over a fake post. Came out right there. I I I could've been in there.

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [715s - 725s]
The bullet exited through Anthony's chest shortly after the suspect had led. At least up and rushed Anthony to the hospital in critical condition unsure if he'd survived.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [725s - 730s]
I said to myself, I'm about to die over a faithful That's what I was saying to myself.

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [731s - 739s]
Although the police report includes very few details, Anthony recalls the suspects that announced themselves as police during a break in and even more captive vests.

🎤 SPEAKER_14 [747s - 754s]
Anthony just hopes the suspects are caught because if they're willing to kill over this pile of old smash, who knows what else they'll do.

🎤 SPEAKER_12 [755s - 760s]
Wasn't even called for him. He had to do all that. Once he found out it wasn't real, he should've just left.

🎤 SPEAKER_11 [859s - 861s]
We're willing to offer $1.85.

🎤 SPEAKER_9 [897s - 898s]
Alright. Come on, ass of you pooped.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [13s - 14s]
Toilet.

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [216s - 222s]
Calciur's triumphant figure popped up from a hunt came in his bar, a look of satisfaction on his face.

👤 あなた [227s - 232s]
the other top, docs Brought his arm up and flunked the dusty wine bottle down on have doubled with amusement. Where'd you find it?

👤 あなた [233s - 244s]
One of the sacred drawers, Kelsier said, dusting off the bottle. I thought I'd found all of those, toxin said. You did. One of them had a false back.

👤 あなた [244s - 277s]
Dachshund chuckled. Clever. Cal nodded, unstoppering the bottle and pouring out three cups. The trick is to never stop looking at as always, another secret too. If you have enough three cups, you'll welcome join with the dachshund at the table. The next accepted her cup with a tentative hand. The meeting ended a short time earlier, raised him indeed leaving to ponder the things Kelsior had told him. It felt that she should have left as well, but she had nowhere to go.

👤 あなた [278s - 287s]
Dachshund and Kelsey are seemed to take it for granted that she would remain with the them. Gelsier took a long sip of the Rubicon wine, then smiled.

👤 あなた [288s - 301s]
That's much better. Dachshund nodded in agreement, but then didn't taste her own drink. We're to need another smoker, Daxson noted. Kelsey nodded.

👤 あなた [302s - 314s]
The others seem to check it well, though. Breeze is still Daxson said. He won't back out. Likes a challenge, and he'll never find a challenge greater than this one.

👤 あなた [315s - 329s]
Kelsey smiled. The sun it'd drive him insane to know that we're pulling a job that wasn't in on. Still, he's right to be apprehensive, Dachshund said. I'm a little worried myself.

👤 あなた [330s - 344s]
Kelsey had nodded his agreement than Ben Brown. So are they serious about the plan? Is this still a show for my sake? The two men seemed so competent, yet overthrowing the final empire.

👤 あなた [345s - 358s]
It sooner stop the mists from flowing or the sun from rising. When do your other friends get here? Dachshund asked her. A couple day Kelsey said. Wanting to have another smoker by then.

👤 あなた [358s - 372s]
I'm also gonna need some more ATM. Ducks and framed already. Gulsey or nodded. I spent most of it buying horsera's contract, then used my last minute trusting experimentation.

👤 あなた [373s - 375s]
Trusting, the nobleman

👤 あなた [384s - 392s]
He claimed that the Lord Ruler kept control of the high nobility by many maintaining a monopoly on the medal. Dachshund rubbed his bearded chin.

👤 あなた [394s - 405s]
It aims not easy to come like hell. It took nearly eight months of planning to steal you that last bit. That's because you had to be delicate, Calcio said with a devious smile.

👤 あなた [406s - 418s]
Eyed Calcior with a look of slight apprehension. Calciere just smiled more broadly and Daxin rolled his eyes sighing. Then glanced a bit. You haven't touched your drink.

👤 あなた [419s - 429s]
Ben shook her head. Dachshund waited for an explanation, and eventually, Ben was forced to respond. I like to drink anything. I didn't prepare myself.

👤 あなた [430s - 445s]
Calci or chocolate. She reminds me of Vent. Vent, Daxson said with a snort. Lass is a bit paranoid, but she's not that bad. I swear that man was so jumpy that his own heartbeat could startle him.

👤 あなた [446s - 456s]
The two men shared a laugh. Vin, however, was only made more uncomfortable by the friendly in her. What do they expect of me? Am I to be an apprentice of some sort?

👤 あなた [458s - 472s]
Well then, Dachshund said, are you going to tell me how you plan getting yourself some ATM? Kelsier opened his mouth to respond, but the stares quited with the sound of someone coming down. Kelsier and Dachshund turned.

👤 あなた [472s - 481s]
Vin, of course, had seated herself so she could see both entrances to the room without having to move. Ben expected the newcomer to be one of Cayman's crew members.

👤 あなた [481s - 500s]
Sent to see if Kelsier was done with the lair yet. Therefore, she was completely surprised when the door swung open to reveal the surly gnarled face of the man called Clubs. Gelsier eyes twinkling. He's not surprised. Pleased but not surprised.

👤 あなた [502s - 512s]
Clubs, Calcio said. Clubs stood in the doorway, giving the three of them an impressively disapproving Finally, he hobbled into the room.

👤 あなた [513s - 523s]
A thin, awkward looking teenage boy followed him. The boy fetched club's chair and put it by Kelsey's table. Clubs settled down, grumbling slightly to himself.

👤 あなた [524s - 535s]
Finally, he eyed Calciator with a squinting, wrinkled and edged expression. The soother gone, Breeze? Calcira asked. Yes. He left.

👤 あなた [536s - 547s]
Clubs grunted. Then he hid the bottle of wine. Help your Kelsey said. Clubs waved for the boy to go fetch him a cup from the bar, then turned back to Kelsey.

👤 あなた [549s - 554s]
I had to be sure, he said. Never can trust yourself when a soother is around.

👤 あなた [559s - 571s]
Of gloves, Kelsier said. He couldn't do much to you. Not if you didn't want him to. Clubs shocked it. Unlike suitors, it's not just alomancy.

👤 あなた [572s - 585s]
Men like that, man, you can't trust that you wanna being manipulated when they are around copper or no copper. I wouldn't rely on something like that to get you loyalty, Kelsey said.

👤 あなた [586s - 596s]
So I've heard who upset does the boy poured him a cup of wine. Had to be sure though, had to think about things without that breeze around.

👤 あなた [597s - 606s]
He scoffled, though Ben had trouble determining why, then took the cobman down half a bit and one go. Good wine. He

👤 あなた [611s - 624s]
So the pits really did drive you insane. I completely calcite with a straight face. Bob though, on his face, the expression had it decidedly twisted up.

👤 あなた [626s - 641s]
Through at this time. This so called job of your Kelsey are nodded solemnly. Corrupt down the rest of his wine. But few got yourself a smoker then. Not for the money though.

👤 あなた [642s - 653s]
If you're really serious about top winning a government, then I'm in. Elsa smiled. Don't smile at me. Clubs snapped. I hate that.

👤 あなた [654s - 655s]
I would say.

👤 あなた [661s - 668s]
That sucks the smoker problem. One more Clubs that you're going to fail. That's

👤 あなた [673s - 693s]
He gets the hole eventually anyway. Well, I both are helping us then. Dachshund asked. Because the fox said stepping I was going to get my SARA lighter. At least this way, I'll be able to spit in his face as I go. Over joining the final empire. He's smart.

👤 あなた [694s - 700s]
It's got style. Let's go, kid. We've got a

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1255s - 1274s]
very, very high. Yeah. So they they had me in Lambdaq managing me, then they put me to a diabetic nurse in my search called Yeah. And then the doctor just managed it. Now I have six monthly blood tests. Oh, yeah. And I'm not much about dieting.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1274s - 1276s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1284s - 1296s]
Then. Yeah. No. It's it is hard cut sugar. It's it's it's it is, like, not quite like crack cocaine, but it's addictive.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1296s - 1299s]
Body needs Well, jewel would probably say it's worst.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1299s - 1299s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1300s - 1302s]
And it's not just sugar really. It's

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1303s - 1306s]
just watching what I eat in general. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1306s - 1312s]
I've been in a lot actually over the last month or two about how insulin affects the body.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1312s - 1312s]
Oh, I know.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1312s - 1341s]
Because it's new field, but it's why it's not just one or two people, whole field saying the same thing. I had a great there's a doctor come from his name online explaining about what insulin does. High insulin, so basically, he said this is the simple analogy used that any child could understand which was if you eat more calories than you burn, obviously, that puts on some visceral fats. Yeah. And imagine that fat goes into a refrigerator, like a storage place, like like a cupboard.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1341s - 1353s]
Say. And he said, thing is, if you feel like if you have a calorie deficit, you should automatically then the body will use it think the body will automatically go into that storage and start burning up the fat. Yeah. But that's not the case, they realize.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1354s - 1373s]
What insulin does with a high insulin level or glucose it acts like a padlock on the cupboard. So it actually your body, even if you're in a calorie deficit, it doesn't access the visceral fats and with high insulin because insulin blocks that cupboard from being accessed.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1373s - 1374s]
Mhmm.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1374s - 1391s]
And so what they realized is if you have, like, insulin if you have a high insulin, kind reaction to, like, carbohydrates, bread, sugar, that sort of thing, it effectively blocks off your body being able to access its visceral fat.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1391s - 1391s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1392s - 1395s]
Get rid of it. And get rid of it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1395s - 1447s]
So and so what they realized now is that not you can't it's not you could easily be under you know, you could eat a thousand calories in a day but not burn any fat if that thousand calories is is high high in insulin level, and that's why type, type one diabetics those who have a natural problem with insulin, is they can eat They were born with it. Yeah. They can with it, but because what happens is because they hurt Basically, they can eat and eat and eat, but they can still starve to death. It used to be the case. A 100 a couple of new years ago, you starve to death because even if you ate 10,000 calories, because it wasn't storing in the fat and that's all to do with insulin. So I've learned a lot and and so I've lost two kilograms in the last in the last couple of weeks purely from kind of sugar and not and skipping breakfast. Those two things.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1447s - 1451s]
Kind of sugar, like Like, can do the things you can now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1451s - 1455s]
But I'm so apart from the weekends, I'm allowing myself the weekends.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1455s - 1456s]
That's it. Any action?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1456s - 1479s]
Extras, basically? Cakes, anything that's got added sugar in it? Yeah. Other than fruit maybe. Because what that does is it your insulin level relatively flat. You don't have any insulin spikes and so it's allowing you your body to access the cupboard to burn the fat. So I did a lot of I've been watching a loads of videos on it and it's it's fascinating. And it's kinda like really unlocked. It's really unlocked.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1479s - 1480s]
I'll cut you to look at the Internet.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1482s - 1489s]
Well, I've been following a few guys online. That were pro platforming some of these experts.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1492s - 1494s]
And it and then as you know with your algorithm your algorithm know. Let you know. Right?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1494s - 1508s]
You're not careful, lean on this button Yeah. And the adaptive cruise control kicks in. And so suddenly you're finding yourself Yeah. Whilst it adapts the it matches the speed of the car in front. Good. Good.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1509s - 1513s]
But the thing is, it's a bit over the brake in's a bit strong and reactive.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1513s - 1513s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1514s - 1517s]
So I don't I don't I don't particularly care for it over overreacts this one here.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1518s - 1519s]
What's the cruise control, is it?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1520s - 1533s]
Yeah. It's cruise control, but but then I could set it for 30 or 20, what have you. Yeah. If the car shows down to zero, the car maintains the gap and stops and matches the speed in front, which is pretty impressive.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1533s - 1534s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1535s - 1535s]
Anyway, that's all yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1535s - 1536s]
This this is from this car.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1536s - 1543s]
I'll tell you what. It you've probably seen in Kate's car ventilation.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1543s - 1551s]
It's really stuff I have. I don't pay much attention. Kate shows me stuff only if I need it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1551s - 1579s]
Now this car, it it steams up really easily. Oh. And the other thing they've cut corners on, you know, most window cars you've got, like a little little fabric at the window. You wind down the window it kinda cleans the window for you. Mhmm. These these guys don't have that. So if it's in condensation, you put the window down, you put it back up it comes up exactly the same, which is a bit of a blinking realized they haven't got the built the pad in there? No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1579s - 1586s]
Well, yeah. It doesn't do that. It doesn't do it. It doesn't work. I wonder think Kate's got the same thing. So Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1587s - 1587s]
Anyway, yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1587s - 1590s]
You happy with her car? Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1591s - 1595s]
She's it's it's great. It's the fastest car I've ever had. It's nippy, easy to drive.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1599s - 1608s]
As a few it's obviously the cheapest car in The UK as well. Like, we were facing the prospect of getting a ten year old Thatcher old rubbish car.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1609s - 1611s]
That had sixty, 70,000 miles on the clock.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1611s - 1612s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1613s - 1622s]
Same price as this. Brand new. And we thought, well, we can really know, these cars would be spent $2 on the other car we got rid of. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1623s - 1624s]
In Monyer.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1624s - 1626s]
Cars, they started to cost.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1626s - 1627s]
Right? There's that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1628s - 1631s]
That was £1,800 in one year and so you split that over twelve months and you're like, you want How much is this a month?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1633s - 1633s]
This is a 120.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1633s - 1642s]
It's 300. Yeah. 50 in month. Yeah. And you can replace it after so many years.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1642s - 1644s]
Yeah. Four years, you give it back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1644s - 1644s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1645s - 1659s]
Or get give her back on the end of it or swap it for new or one. So you you sort of like renting it? Yeah. It's kinda like a Yeah. We don't own it and we're we're limited to 6,000 miles a year. Send it type of thing. Right?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1659s - 1659s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1661s - 1674s]
For every 10 for every mile over 6,000 in a year, we pay 10 p. Which unbalanced. We realize that's not that much actually. A thousand miles, you go a thousand miles over, it's an extra quid or something.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1676s - 1676s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1676s - 1677s]
That's not nice.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1678s - 1679s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1679s - 1682s]
That's why this works well for what we use it for, which is

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1682s - 1682s]
Phone tow.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1683s - 1685s]
Yeah. And we always prefer to use the other car if we can.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1685s - 1686s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1686s - 1690s]
So that makes sense? So we've had this now since September and we've got 100 miles on it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1690s - 1697s]
So do you not navigate to one car, should you navigate the other or do you just mix and match? Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1697s - 1703s]
It tends to be Rachel takes the other car because she she travels the bridge end every day. Oh. Well, Tuesday to Thursday.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1707s - 1709s]
And where'd you where'd you go now to let to Philip.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1709s - 1710s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1711s - 1719s]
So quite it's quite useful. Anytime I go to shop and take plug it in there. But also when Jira has football training on Thursday nights, we park at Tesco's.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1720s - 1729s]
Plug it in, and then walk over to the Oh, yeah. Sporty. And and then by the time back, it's charged.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1730s - 1731s]
Is there?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1731s - 1732s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1732s - 1734s]
That depends on if I'm using the faster one or not.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1735s - 1741s]
I used to put put your card on there, do you? It just Yeah. Charges automatically back.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1741s - 1757s]
Well, yeah. And you well, you we got the thing that's a bit annoying. I've got about five apps on my phone for different networks and things. There's one app called Pod Points where oh, Zap Map, sorry, where you can almost use it to charge on lots of networks and you just it connects to your bank account and it just and it just you.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1760s - 1761s]
Zap map.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1762s - 1762s]
And what's it do?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1762s - 1767s]
It's like Google Maps but with the part charging points.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1767s - 1768s]
Ah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1768s - 1773s]
And then you click on the charging point, and then you can pay for it on that through through the app rather than have to go through

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1773s - 1774s]
How much that goes?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1776s - 1780s]
Well, the app itself is free, but the charge in it Oh, they check the check the they took a little bit of money.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1781s - 1782s]
They they don't actually.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1782s - 1784s]
First as far as I can tell.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1785s - 1786s]
Well, unless we've done it somehow.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1786s - 1787s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1787s - 1788s]
Maybe I don't know if it's fund I don't if it's ad funded or something.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1792s - 1800s]
But ja, I mean next generation of driving instructors after you, maybe the next, I imagine, will be doing electric by ten to twenty years.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1801s - 1802s]
Ten years time from now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1803s - 1803s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1804s - 1808s]
Because we're we're getting Automatic? And electric.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1808s - 1809s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1809s - 1815s]
You see a lot more electrics around now. Don't know if you've noticed by it. Maybe I've just noticed because I've got one of these.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1816s - 1825s]
Well, yeah. You But for me, the biggest problem they've got is charging points.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1825s - 1826s]
Yeah. Oh, yeah. We are in a bit of a yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1827s - 1828s]
And a bit of a pickle.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1828s - 1839s]
They're gonna match that up. Can't try to get to talk about it in her in her group. She's a director of in her where she lives in.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1839s - 1840s]
Oh, yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1840s - 1841s]
She point to go a group.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1846s - 1850s]
I have Oh, yeah. Manages things there. And they wouldn't have it. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1850s - 1853s]
We just didn't want it. No. I know.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1853s - 1854s]
It's the same.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1854s - 1857s]
They're still they're still a risk of fire and stuff. So they they're not Barely.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1857s - 1879s]
Yeah. And it's just bit of a reaction. I don't know when do it because he said it was too too early. Too early for what? In terms of he thinks he could have the the standards could evolve and mature a bit over time. He not planning it. But even but he's wrong about it because it has matured, it has settled, the people are getting charged him.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1879s - 1881s]
It's being standardized now, the charging points.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1881s - 1886s]
So maybe you can approach it again with him. No. Would it ever roll back with this?

👤 あなた [1886s - 1886s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1887s - 1887s]
I'll take my fourth accelerator now.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1887s - 1899s]
Now. Hold over the brake. In fact, if you put your foot in the brake, it holds, but you don't need to. In fact, it's it's I'm not on anything at the minute. I'm just hovering.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1899s - 1907s]
Mum's MG is what they call automatic. So it could roll back a little bit if you're not careful.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1907s - 1907s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1908s - 1917s]
You put your foot on the brake, you put the hand brake up, and then when you go on to gas Yeah. And it drives off. There's a way of doing it, but it's not great at reversing up hill. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1917s - 1923s]
Mum's telling me that. I take what. Listen. I'm not joking, dad. I think this car can I don't if you've been in have you driven Kate's car this year?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1923s - 1924s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1924s - 1924s]
I've done not too.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1925s - 1933s]
First. It it can go I'm not joking. If you this is a problem for learners to tackle if they get a car like this, the learner driver. It can reverse about 15 miles an hour.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1934s - 1942s]
You'd go into reverse, you put your foot down like that. It is because there's no gear, there's no gears, it's just one engine that does everything.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1943s - 1951s]
One motor rather. It's it's the same motor for reversing. Yeah. It must be clamped somehow. Tracy. Right. Am I going all the up to top around the vents?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1951s - 1953s]
All way up and all the way around and back down a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1953s - 1954s]
Right. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1954s - 1957s]
That's fine. So I'll give you plenty of warning. Just keep going right Alrighty.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1958s - 1960s]
Is it a drop off point?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1960s - 1961s]
Know? Yep.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1961s - 1962s]
Well,

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1962s - 1964s]
yeah. There's a place I can just swing out here.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1967s - 1969s]
Okay. Well, yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1973s - 1975s]
Hopefully, you have my you you do in your you say you you find all the stations that you're doing? Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1975s - 1989s]
I got I got it. It's like a lot going on. I got a common dissertation, but I've also got an s due on Ezekiel chapter 38, which is challenging. So now I'll call about Gog of Magog.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1989s - 2004s]
Oh, good good. And it's an I recall about this god raising this army from all over the world to attack Israel. Oh. God self raises them up and he he forces them to do it. And then once they attack Israel, he defeats them and shows them.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2005s - 2009s]
And it's kind of understanding that because some people misunderstand it as an end time prophecy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2010s - 2019s]
Well, I would have thought this big army, if you talk more like the last day, Yeah. I thought I didn't think the that God was raising that up.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2020s - 2037s]
Yes. Well, god seems to do that a lot. Know, for example, when Israel got split into two, you got the Northern Kingdom Of Israel and the second kingdom of Judah. Got both times where they got conquered and took into Israel into exile. God was the one who raised the army against his own people as a judgment.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2037s - 2071s]
He he made the Assyrians attack Israel and the Babylonians attacked Judah. It was god. It was a judgment upon them for their lack of of keeping the covenant with him. And so god does that. But and Revelation also talks about Gog and Me, Gog at the end high battle. But what people don't realize about Revelation is that it tracks very similarly to It's almost like John had a copy of Ezekiel next to him. And so there's lots of overlap. And so when he talks about Gog Magog, he's talking about the one that we're doing in. Anyway, it's complicated and a bit boring to boring.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2071s - 2078s]
See it there? You want to go in? Just drop you. Okay. Drop off soon. Day surgery. This is the boy.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2078s - 2088s]
Oh, there we are. So, dad, fellow, just pray for dad. I pray, Lord, that this the surgery is successful and that that it's easy and

👤 あなた [2169s - 2174s]
Dad is going for his surgery on his ear today. Day surgery.

👤 あなた [2183s - 2188s]
I've just literally dropped him off now. Sorry. I thought I told you I was doing this.

👤 あなた [2219s - 2221s]
I just dropped dad. At

👤 あなた [2228s - 2229s]
For day surgery on his ear.

👤 あなた [2232s - 2234s]
Probably general anesthetic.

👤 あなた [2238s - 2240s]
Should be home by tea time.

👤 あなた [2256s - 2267s]
I think Pops wanted to keep it on the down low. And not cause a fuss. I only know that it's today because I was asked to give him a lifting.

👤 あなた [2321s - 2321s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2322s - 2347s]
We're in his oblinators. He gets the whole eventually lead in the way. Well, I thought I helped him this day. Dachshund asked. Because pups stepping. The Lord's going to get me sooner or later. At least this way, I'll be able to in his face as go. Overthrowing the final empire he smiled. It's got style.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2349s - 2360s]
Let's go, kid. We've gotta get the shop ready for visitors. Then watch them go, club slimping out the door at the pulling it closed behind him. Then she glanced.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2362s - 2382s]
You knew he'd come back. He shrugged, standing and stretching. I hoped people are attracted to vision. The job I'm proposing, well, the not if you're a bored old man who's generally annoyed at life.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2384s - 2403s]
Now then I assume that your crew owns this entire building. It nodded. The shop upstairs is a front. Good, Calcior said, checking his pocket watch that handing it to Dachshund. Tell your friends that they can have their lair back. The mists are probably already coming out.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2404s - 2422s]
And thus, Thucson asked. Kelsior smiled. We're going to the roof. I can told you, I have to catch some ATL. My day, Ruth Adele was a blackened city, scorched by soot and red sunlight.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2423s - 2438s]
It was hard, distinct, and oppressive. At night, however, the mists came to blur and obscure. High noble keeps became ghostly looming silhouettes Streets seemed to grow more narrow in the fog.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2439s - 2454s]
Every peril fair becoming a lonely dangerous alleyway. Even noblemen and thieves were apprehensive. By day, Ruthadel was a blackened city scorched by certain red sunlight.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2455s - 2473s]
Was hard, distinct, and oppressive. At night, however, the mists came to blur and obscure. High noble keeps became ghost looming silhouettes. Streets seemed to grow more narrow in the fog. Every thorough fare becoming a lonely dangerous alleyway.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2474s - 2482s]
Even noblemen and thieves were apprehensive about going out at night. It took a strong heart to brave the foreboding misty silence.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2483s - 2490s]
The dark city at night was a place for the desperate and the foolhardy It was a land of swirling mystery and strange creatures.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2492s - 2531s]
Strange creatures like me, Calcio thought. He stood upon a ledge that ran around the lid by the flat roofed blare. Shadowed buildings loomed in the night around him, and the mists made everything seem to shift and move on the darkness. Weak lights peeked from the occasional window with a tiny beats of illumination or huddled frightened things. A cool breeze slipped across the rooftop, shifting the haze, brushing against calcium mist wedded cheek like an exhaled breath. In days past, sought out a rooftop on the evening before a job, wishing to overlook the city.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2532s - 2541s]
He didn't realize he was observing his old custom this night until he glanced to the side, expecting Mayar to be there next to him as she always had been.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2542s - 2558s]
Instead, he found only the empty air. Lonely, silent, The mists had replaced her. Poorly. He sighed and turned. Ben and Dachshund stood behind him on the rooftop.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2559s - 2567s]
Both looked apprehensive to be out in the mists, but they dealt with their fear. One did not get far in the underworld without learning to stomach the mists.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2569s - 2581s]
Kelsier had learned to do far more than stomach them. He had gone among them so often during the last few years that he was beginning feel more comfortable at night within the mist's obscuring embrace than he did at day.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2583s - 2595s]
Kel, Dachshund said. Do you have to stand on a ledge like that? Our plans may be a bit crazy. But I'd rather not have them end with you splattered across the cobblestones down there.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2596s - 2603s]
Calcior smiled. He still doesn't think that these are misborn, he thought. It will take some getting used to for all of them.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2605s - 2633s]
Years before, he had become the most infamous crew leader in Lithadal. And he had done it without even being an alamancer. May had been a tini, but he and dachshund they had just been regular men. One and a half with no powers, the other a runaway plantation ska. Together, they had brought great houses to their knees, feeling rash from the most powerful men in the final empire. Now Kelce here was more.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2633s - 2638s]
Sake. So much more. Once he had dreamed of Alamansi,

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2645s - 2657s]
Unlike Mary's, she had been dead he'd smashed, coming to his powers. She would never see what he would do with them. Before, the high nobility had feared him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2657s - 2667s]
It had taken a trap set by the Lord himself to capture Caelcia. Now a final empire itself would shake before he was finished with it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2669s - 2679s]
He scanned the city once more, breathing in the mists, and hopped down off the ledge and strode up a ducks in a bin. They carried no lights.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2679s - 2700s]
Alien starlight accused by the mists was enough to see by in most cases. Calcium Took Off His Jacket And Passed, Heading Him To Dachshund, and he untucked his shirt by the long garment hang loose. The fabric was dark enough that it give the way in the night. Alright. Kelsey said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2700s - 2715s]
Who should I try? The doxen frowned. You're sure you want to do this, Calcior smiled. Docs inside. Houses are paying antennae to be hit recently, but not for their ATM.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2716s - 2727s]
House is the strongest right now? Kelsior asked, squatting down and undoing the ties on his pack, which rested by ducks and feet. Who would no one consider hitting?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2728s - 2738s]
Dachshund paused. Venture, he finally said. They've been on top for the last few years. They keep a standing force of several 100 men.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2739s - 2771s]
The local house nobility includes a good two dozen listings. Calcior nodded. Well, that's where I'll go then. They are certain to have some ATL. He pulled open a path then whipped out a dark gray cloak, large and enveloping the wasn't constructed from a single piece of cloth. Rather, it was made up of hundreds of long ribbon like strips. They were sewn together at the shoulders across the chest, but mostly they hung separate from what an like overlapping streamers.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2773s - 2786s]
Threw on the garment, its strips of cloth twisting curling, almost like the mists themselves. Hailed softly. I had never been so close to someone wearing one of those.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2787s - 2798s]
What is it? Lynn asked. Her quiet boys almost haunting in the night mists. A missed cluck, Dachshund said. They all wear the things.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2798s - 2812s]
It's kind of like a sign of membership in their club. It's colored and constructed to hide you in the mist. Kelsey said. And it warns city guards and other mist born not to bother you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2813s - 2825s]
He spun, letting the cloak flare dramatically. I think it suits me. Dachshund rolled his eyes. Alright, Kelsier said, bending down and pulling a cloth belt from his bag.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2826s - 2837s]
House venture. Is there anything I need to know? Lord Venture supposedly has a safe in his study, Daxson said. That's where he'd probably keep his ATM-stache.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2838s - 2849s]
You'll find the study on the 3rd Floor, three rooms in from the upper southern balcony. Be careful. House Venture keeps about a dozen haze killers in addition to its regular troops and mistings.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2850s - 2860s]
Calcio nodded, tying on the belt. It had no buckle, but it did contain two small sheaths. He pulled a pair of glass daggers from the bag.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2861s - 2869s]
Checked them for nicks, and slid them into the sheaths. He kicked off his shoes and stripped off his stockings. Leaving himself barefoot on the chillstones.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2870s - 2877s]
With the shoes also and the last bit of metal on his purse, save for his coin pouch and the three vials of metals in his belt.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2878s - 2887s]
He selected the largest one, downed its contents, then handed the empty vial to Dachshund. Let it? Kelsira asked. Dachshund nodded.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2889s - 2905s]
Good luck. Poseidon, the girl then, was watching Kelsey's preparation. With intense curiosity. She was a quiet small thing but she hid an intensity that he found impressive She was paranoid, true, but not timid.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2907s - 2918s]
You'll get your chance, kid, he thought. Just not to know. Well, he said, pulling a coin from his pouch and tossing it off the side of the building. Yes. I'll be going.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2919s - 2921s]
I'll make you back at Club's shop in a bit.

👤 あなた [2921s - 2922s]
Talks and it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2923s - 2948s]
Kelsey had turned and walked back up onto the rope's sledge. Then he jumped off the building. Mist pearled in the air around him. He burned steel second the basic aluminic metals, translucent blue lines is running to existing surrounding visible only to his eyes. Each one led from the center of his chest out to a nearby source of metal.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2949s - 2964s]
A lines were all relatively faint. A sign that they pointed to metal sources that were small, door hinges, nails, and other bits. But type of source metal didn't matter. Burning iron or steel would point blue lines at all kinds of rhenolan.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2964s - 2983s]
Assuming they were close enough and large enough to be noticeable. Kelsey had shows the line that pointed directly beneath him toward his coin. Burning steel, he pushed against the coin. His descent immediately stopped, and he was thrown back up into the air in the opposite direction along the blue line.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2984s - 3000s]
He reached out to the side, selected a passing window clasp, and pushed again. It, angling himself to the side. A careful nudge him publicly over the lip of the building directly across the street through Vince's lair. Gelsier landed with a wide step.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3000s - 3008s]
Falling into a crouch and running across the building's peaked roof. He paused in the darkness at the other side, peering through the swirling air.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3009s - 3013s]
He burned tin and felt it flirt alive in his chest and had

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3018s - 3028s]
It wasn't that the night around him grew any lighter. His ability to perceive simply increased, and the distance to the north in adjusts to the they make out a large structure.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3029s - 3040s]
Keep adventure. Calcium left is too low. He burned slowly, and he probably need worry about running out as he stood in the mists.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3040s - 3053s]
Curled slightly around his body. They twisted spun, running in a slight barely noticeable current to the side. The knew him. They claimed him. They could sense palimancy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3055s - 3069s]
He jumped, pushing against a metal chimney behind him, sending himself in a wide horizontal leap. Tossed a coin even as he jumped. A tiny bit of metal flickering through the darkness and fog. He pushed against the coin before it hit the ground.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3070s - 3077s]
The force of his weight grabbing it downward in a sharp As soon as it hit the cobblestones, Kelsior's pushing forced him upward.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3077s - 3089s]
Turning the second half of his leap into a graceful park. Landed on another peaked wooden rooftop. Steel push and iron pulling were the first things that Gimmo had taught him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3090s - 3106s]
When you push on something, it's like you're throwing your weight against it. The old blood ticket said. And you can't change how much you weigh You're an elements are not some northern mystic. Don't pull on something that weighs less than you unless you want it to come flying at you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3107s - 3117s]
And don't push on something heavier than you unless you want to get in the other direction. Kelsey scratched his scars, then pulled his missed cloak tight.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3117s - 3126s]
As he crouched on the roof. The wooden grain biting his unshot toes. He often wished that burning tin didn't enhance all of the senses.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3127s - 3139s]
Or at least not all of them at once. He needed the improved eyesight to see in the darkness, and he made good use of the improved hearing as well. However, burning tin made at night seem even more chilly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3139s - 3153s]
To his overly sensitive skin, and his feet registered every pebble wooden ripple that touched. Keep Venture rose before him. Compared with the murky city, the keep seemed to blaze with light.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3154s - 3166s]
I noble skipped different schedules from regular people. The ability to afford, even squander, lamp or and candles, meant that the wealthy didn't have to bow before the whims of season or sun.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3167s - 3192s]
The cape was majestic. That one was visible simply from the architecture. While it maintained a defensive wall around the grounds, the cube itself was more an artistic construction than a fortification. Sturdy buttressings are ardened out from the sides. The allowing for intricate windows and delicate spires. Brilliant stained glass windows stretched high along the sides of a rectangular building.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3193s - 3204s]
They show with light from within, given the surrounding mists of irrigated glow. Kelsey of burnt iron flaring its strong and searching the night of the large sources of metal.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3205s - 3219s]
He was too far away from the keep to use small items like coins or hinges. You'd need a larger anchor to cover this distance. Most of the blue lines were faint. Calcium marked a couple of them moving in a slow pattern up ahead.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3220s - 3232s]
Probably a pair of guards standing on the rooftop. Calcium would be sensing their breastplates and weapons. Despite palomantic considerations, most noblemen still armed their soldiers with metal.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3233s - 3247s]
Mistings who could push or pull metals were uncommon. And full mistborn were even more so. Many lords thought it impractical to leave one's soldiers and guards relatively defenseless in order to counter such a small segment of the population.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3249s - 3271s]
Now most high, the woman relied on other means to deal with alamanswers. Kelsey Dachshund had said that blood venturer kept a squad of haze killers. If that was true, Kelcio would probably meet them before the night was through. He ignored the soldiers for the instead focusing on a summit line of blue pointing toward the keep's mofty top.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3272s - 3283s]
It likely had bronze or copper sheeting on the roof. Calcior flared his iron, took a deep breath, and pulled a the line. With a sudden jerk, he was yanked into the air.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3284s - 3305s]
Continued to burn iron, pulling himself toward the keep at a tremendous speed. Some rumors claimed that Mistborn could fly, but that was a wistful exaggeration. Bulling and pushing a direction. An palomancer had to pull hard in order to get the proper momentum.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3306s - 3321s]
And this sent him hurdling toward his anchor at daunting speeds. Kelsey are shot toward the keep, mists, around him. He easily cleared the protective walls surrounding the keep's grounds, but his body dropped slightly toward the ground as he moved.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3322s - 3325s]
It was his pesky weight again. It tugged him down.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3336s - 3341s]
Angled slightly toward the ground as it flew. The drag of his weight

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [0s - 27s]
The rooftop, still traveling at a terrible speed. Taking a deep breath, Kelsey pewter, using it to enhance its physical strength much in the same way that tin enhanced his senses. He turned himself in the air in muscles protected from treatment, but he stopped without breaking any He immediately released his hold on the roof, dropped me a car in motion.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [33s - 44s]
Against selecting a source of metal above him. One of the wire housings of a stained glass window and pulled on it. The coin hit the ground below and was suddenly able to support his weight. Elsear lobs himself upward, pushing on the coin.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [44s - 65s]
Pulling on a window at the same time. Then, extinguishing both metals, he let momentum carrying the last few feet of darkness. Cloak the flat flapping quietly. He crusted the lip of the keep's upper surface walkway lifted himself over the stone railing, and quietly on the ledge. A startled guard stood not three paces away.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [66s - 77s]
Calcier was upon the man in a second, jumping into the air. Pulling slightly on the guards to steal breastplate, throwing them in off balance. Josia whipped out one of his glass daggers.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [77s - 90s]
Allowing the strength of his iron holding to bring him toward the guard. He with both feet against the man's chest, then crouched and sliced with a pure enhanced swing. The guard collapsed with a slit throat.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [91s - 106s]
Pelsier landed lively beside him, ears straining in a night There were none. Kelsior left regard to his gurgling demise. The man was likely a lesser noblehood, the enemy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [107s - 110s]
If you were instead that Sa soldier and

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [114s - 135s]
Josia was even happier to send such men into their eternity. He pushed off the dying man's breastplate, pumping off the stone, so they're forth way, and onto the rooftop itself. The bronze roof with a chill is slightly the He a moment, heading toward the southern side of the building, looking to the top of any docks and attention.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [137s - 150s]
He wasn't too worried about being spotted. One purpose of this evening was to steal some ATL for the tenth and most purpose, however, was to cause a commotion.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [151s - 175s]
He found the balcony with ease, wide and broad it was probably a sitting balcony used to entertain small groups. It was quiet at the moment, however, empty and safe for two guards. Kelsey are crouching solidly in the nightmare about the balcony, fertile gray cloak obscuring you, toes proving out over the side of the ropes, metallic lymph.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [176s - 180s]
Two guards chatting confidently below. Time to make a whip.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [193s - 215s]
He's pushed through the guards away in opposite directions. The cried out in surprise as the sudden force them back ward, hurling them over the balcony railing into the dark threw open the balcony doors, letting a wall of mist fall inward around him, its creeping forward to claim the darkened from beyond.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [217s - 230s]
Third poem, the calcium thought will lean forward in crouching run. The second groom was a quiet, greenhouse light conservative conservatory. Low beds containing cultivated bushes and small trees ramped through the room.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [230s - 246s]
One wall was made up of enormous broad ceiling windows. Provide sunlight for the plants. Though it was dark, Calcier knew that the plants were all be of slightly different colors than the typical brown. Some would be white, others, white, and perhaps even a few light yellow.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [247s - 264s]
Clants that weren't brown were rarely cultivated and kept by the inability. Calcior moved quickly through the conservatory. He paused to the next doorway, noting its lighted outline. He his tin, lest his enhanced eyes be blinded when he entered the lip.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [264s - 275s]
Room and threw open the door. He ducked inside looking against the light, a glass dagger in each hand. The room, however, was empty. It was obviously a study.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [276s - 305s]
A ledger burned on each wall beside bookcases. You had a desk in the corner. Kelsey replaced his burning steel and pitching for sources of metal. There was a large safe in the corner of the room that was swapping Sure enough, another strong source of metal inside the eastern wall. Calcira approached, running his fingers along the plaster. Like many wolves and noble keeps, this one was painted with a soft mural.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [306s - 316s]
Foreign creatures lounged beneath a red sun, The false section of wall was under two feet square, and it had been placed that its cracks were obscured by the mural.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [317s - 337s]
There's always another secret, Kelsey or thought. He didn't bother trying to figure out how to open the contraption. He simply burned steel, reaching in and tugging against the weak source of metal that he assumed post the trapdoor's locking mechanism. It resisted it first, pulling him against the wall, but he burned a pewter and he act harder.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [338s - 355s]
The lock snapped and the panel swung open, revealing a small safe embedded in the wall. Kelsey had smiled. It looked small enough for a pewter at to carry, assuming he could get it in of the wall. He jumped up under pulling against the safe.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [364s - 379s]
Strength of fluttered flags and declared steel well, pulling against the same. Strained grunting slightly at the impression. It was chest to see which would give out first the safe for his legs.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [380s - 392s]
The safe shifted in its mountings. Telsier pulled harder muscles per chesting. For an extended moment, nothing happened. Then the safe shook and ripped free at the wall.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [392s - 404s]
Kelsier fell backward, burning steel and pushing against the safe to get out of the way. He landed malatoid to it, sweat dripping from his brow as the safe crashed the wooden floor, destroying his splinters.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [405s - 433s]
A pair of startled guards burst into the room About time. See what I did. Raising a hand and pulling on one of the soldier's sword. It whipped out of its sheep, spinning in the air and streaking toward Kelsier Point first. The his iron, stepping to the side and catching the sword by its hilt, momentum heredity passed. Mistborn, the guard screamed. Kelsior smiled and jumped forward.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [434s - 442s]
The guard pulled out a dagger. Kelsior pushed it, tearing weapon off the man's hand, and the swamp shearing the guard's head from his body.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [442s - 446s]
The second guard, first, chugging three to release his tigh on his breastplate.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [451s - 467s]
Ripped from his fingers and hissed directly toward the second guard. The man's armor dropped free, venting Kelsier from pushing his feet just as the sword blended itself in the second guard's now unarmored chest.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [468s - 501s]
Man stumbled quietly, then collapsed. Kelsi returned from the bodies, cloaked rustling His anger was quiet, not as fierce as it had been that he'd killed Lord Trusthake. But he felt it still, Noted in the itching of his scars, continued numbered screams of As far as Kelsey was concerned, any man who upheld the final fire also forfeited his right to widen her. He flared his pewter, strengthening his body, then squatted down and lifted the safe.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [501s - 519s]
He teetered for a second beneath his wake. The same guy's bowels and began to shuffle back toward the balcony. Perhaps the he didn't have time to search out other options. He was halfway through the conservatory when he heard footsteps from behind.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [520s - 537s]
He turned to see the study flooding with figures. There were eight of them, each one wearing a loose gray robe and carrying a jeweling cane and a shield instead of sword. Haze killers. Kelsier let the safe drop to the ground. Hayes killers weren't alimancers.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [538s - 545s]
But they were trained to try to connect them and have missed porn. There wouldn't be a single bit of on their bodies, and they would be ready for his drinks.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [546s - 556s]
Calcio stepped back, stretching and smiling. The eight men fanned into the study, moving with quiet precision. This should be interesting.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [557s - 567s]
The haze colors attacked, dashing by twos into the conservatory. Pulled out his dagger ducking beneath the first attack and slicing at a man's chest.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [567s - 577s]
The hazekiller jumped back, however, and forced Kelsier away with a swing of his cane. Flared his pewter, letting strengthened legs carry him back in a powerful jump.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [578s - 599s]
With one hand, he whipped out a handful of coins and pushed them against his opponents. The middle discs shot forward, zipping the air, but his enemies were ready for this. They raised their shields, and the coins bounced off the wood, throwing up splinters but leaving the men on harmed. Kelsier eyed the other haze killers as they filled the room advancing on him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [599s - 610s]
They couldn't hope to fight him in an extended battle. Their tactic would be to rush him at once, hoping for a quick end to the fight, or to at least him until Alamanswers could be awakened and brought to the fight.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [611s - 625s]
He glanced at the safe as he landed. He couldn't leave without it. He needed to end the fight quickly as well. Flaring pewter, he jumped forward, trying an experimental dagger swipe, but he couldn't get inside his opponent's defenses.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [626s - 635s]
Kelsier barely ducked away in time to avoid getting cracked in the head by the end of a cane. Three of the hazekillers dashed behind him, cutting off his retreat into the balcony room.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [636s - 645s]
Great, thought. Trying to keep an eye on all eight men at once. They advanced on him with careful precision, working as a team.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [646s - 657s]
Gritting his teeth, Calcier flared his pewter again. It was running low, he noticed. Pewter was the fastest burning of the base eight metals. No time to worry about that now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [658s - 669s]
The men behind him attacked, and Kelsier jumped out of the way, pulling on the safe to himself toward the center of the room. He pushed a soon as he hit the ground near the safe, launching himself into the air at an angle.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [670s - 681s]
He tucked, flipping over the heads of two attackers and landed on the ground beside a well tree bed, he spun flaring his and raising his arm in defense against the swing he knew would come.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [682s - 694s]
The dueling came connected with his arm. A burst of pain ran down his but his pewter enhanced bone held. Kelsier kept moving, driving his other hand forward and slamming a dagger into his opponent's chest.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [695s - 706s]
The man stumbled back in surprise. The motion ripping away Kelsier's dagger. A second haze killer attacked, but Kelsier ducked, then reached down with his free hand, ripping his coin pouch off of his belt.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [706s - 713s]
The haze color prepared to block Calcier's remaining dagger, but Calcier raised his other hand instead, slamming the coin pouch into the man's shield.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [714s - 733s]
Then he pushed on the coins inside. The hazekiller cried out, the force of the intense steel push throwing him backward. Kelsier flared his steel, pushing hard that he tossed himself backward as well, away from the pair of men who had tried to attack him. Celsier and his enemy flew away from each other hurled in opposite directions.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [734s - 742s]
Collided with the far wall but kept pushing, smashing his opponent, pouching shield and all, against one of the massive conservatory windows.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [743s - 756s]
Glass shattered, sparkles of lantern light from the study playing across its shards. The haze color's desperate face disappeared into the darkness beyond, and mist, quiet yet ominous, began to creep in through the shattered window.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [758s - 772s]
The other six men advanced relentlessly, and was forced to ignore the pain in his arm as he ducked two swings. He spun out of the way, brushing past a small tree, but a third hazekiller attacked, smashed his cane into Kelcear's side.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [772s - 779s]
The attack threw Kelsior into the tree bed. He tripped, then collapsed near the entrance to the lit study, dropping his dagger.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [780s - 788s]
He gasped in pain, rolling to his knees and holding his side. The blow would have broken another man's ribs. Even Kelsier would have a massive bruise.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [789s - 804s]
The six men moved forward, spreading to surround him again. Kelsier stumbled to his feet, vision growing dizzy from pain and exertion. He gritted his teeth, reaching down and pulling out one of his remaining vials of metal. He downed his contents in a single gulp.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [804s - 812s]
Replenishing his pewter, then burned tin. The light nearly blinded him, and the pain in his arm and side suddenly seemed more acute.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [813s - 829s]
But the burst of enhanced senses cleared his head. The six hazekillers advanced in a sudden coordinated attack. Kelsier whipped his hand to the side, burning iron and searching for metal. The closest source was a thick, silvery paperweight on a desk just inside the study.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [830s - 838s]
Kelsier flipped it into his hand, then turned, arm held toward the advancing men, falling into an offensive stance. All right.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [838s - 846s]
He growled. Kelsior burned still with a flash of strength. The rectangular ingot ripped from his hand, streaking through the air.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [847s - 854s]
The foremost haze killer raised his shield, but he moved too slowly. Ingot hit the man's shoulder with a crunch, and he dropped, crying out.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [855s - 867s]
Kelsier spun to the side, ducking a staff swing and putting a haze killer himself and the fallen man. He burned iron, pulling the ingot back toward him. It whipped through the air, cracking the second haze killer in the side of the head.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [867s - 908s]
The men collapsed as the engat flipped into the air. One of the remaining men cursed, rushing forward to attack. He'll pushed the still airborne ingot, flipping it away from him, and away from the attacking haze killer who had his shield raised. Calcier heard the ingot hit the ground behind him, and he reached up, burning pewter, and caught the hazekiller's cane mid swing. The hazekiller grunted, struggling against Kelsier's enhanced strength. Kelsier did bother trying to pull the weapon free. Instead, he pulled sharply on the ingot behind him, bringing it toward his own back at a deadly speed. He twisted at the last moment, using his momentum to spin the haze cooler around right until the ingot's path. The man dropped.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [909s - 920s]
Kelsier flared pewter, steadying himself against attacks. Sure enough, a cane smashed against his shoulders. Stumbled to his knees as the wood cracked, but flared tin kept him conscious.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [921s - 930s]
Pain and lucidity flashed through his mind. He pulled on the ingot, ripping it out of the dying man's back, and stepped to the side, letting the impromptu weapon shoot past him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [931s - 940s]
The two haze killers nearest him crouched warily. The ingot snapped into one of the men's shields, but Kelsier didn't continue pushing unless he himself off balance.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [940s - 958s]
Instead, burnt iron, wrenching the ingot back toward him. Self. He ducked, extinguishing iron, and feeling the ingot through the air above him. There was a crack as it collided with the man who had been sneaking up on him. Kelsey or spun burning iron and steel to send ingots soaring toward the final two men.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [958s - 970s]
They stepped out of the way, but Calciard tugged on the ingot, dropping it to the ground directly in front of them. The men regarded it warily, distracted as Calsius ran and jumped, still pushing himself against the ingot and flipping over the men's heads.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [971s - 997s]
The hasecurers cursed, spinning. As Kelsier landed, he pulled the ingot again, bringing it up to smash into a man's skull from behind. The haze killer fell silently. The ingot flipped a few times in the darkness, and Kelsier snatched it from the air. Its cool surface slick with blood. Mist from the shattered window flowed by a speaker curling up around his legs. He brought his hand down, pointing at directly at the last remaining days to her.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [998s - 1005s]
Somewhere in the room, a foreign man groaned. The remaining hazekillers stepped back, then dropped his weapon and dashed away.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1006s - 1033s]
Kelsier smiled, lowering his hand. Suddenly, the ingot was pushed from his fingers. It shy across the room, smashing through another window. Kelsey are cursed. Spinning to see another larger group of men pouring into the study. They wore the clothing of noblemen, alamancers, Several of them raised hands and a flurry of coins shot toward He flared steel, pushing the coins out of the way.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1033s - 1052s]
Windows shattered and wood splintered as the room was sprayed with coins. Kelsier felt a tug on his belt as his final vial of metal was ripped away, pulled toward the other room. Several burly men ran forward in a crouch, staying beneath recruiting coins. Hugs, misting the two like ham could burn pewter.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1057s - 1066s]
Another wave of coins, gritting his teeth against the pain in his side and arm. He behind him. Had a few moans, but he was never going to make it back to the balcony.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1067s - 1079s]
As more mistings advanced, Kelcia took a deep breath and dashed toward one of the broken floor to ceiling windows. He leapt out into the mists, turning in the air as he fell, and reached out to pull firmly on the fallen safe.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1079s - 1091s]
He jerked in mid air, swinging down toward the side of the building as if tied to the safe by tether. He felt the safe slide forward, grinding the floor of the conservatory as Kelsier's weight pulled against it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1092s - 1102s]
He slammed against the side of the building but continued to pull, catching him self on the upper side of a window sill. He strained, standing upside down the window well, pulling on the safe.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1103s - 1110s]
The safe appeared over the lip of the floor above. It teetered, then fell out the window and began to plummet directly toward Calcira.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1110s - 1124s]
He smiled, extinguishing his iron and pushing away from the building with his leg, throwing himself out into the like some insaning doggy bear. He tailed backwards with the darkness. Family catching sight of an angry face poking out of the broken window above.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1125s - 1143s]
Kelsier pulled carefully against the safe, moving himself in the air. Mists curled around him, obscuring his vision, making him feel as if he weren't falling at all, but hanging in the middle of nothingness. He reached the safe, then twisted in the air and pushed against it, throwing himself upward.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1144s - 1155s]
The safe crashed into the cobblestones just below. Kelceer pushed against the safe slightly, slowing himself until he eventually jerked to a halt in the air just a few feet above the ground.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1155s - 1163s]
He hung in the mists for a moment, ribbons from his cloak curling and flapping in the wind, then let himself drop to the ground beside this hayfe.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1164s - 1173s]
The strong rocks had been shattered by the fall. Helsier pried open its mangled front, enhanced ears listening to calls of alarm from the building above.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1174s - 1182s]
Inside the safe he found a small pouch of gemstones and a couple of 10,000 boxing letters of credit. And all of which he pocketed.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1183s - 1197s]
He felt around inside, suddenly worried that the knights work had been for naught. Then his fingers found it. A small pouch at the very back. He pulled it open revealing a grouping of dark bead like bits of metal.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1198s - 1212s]
Atium. His scars flared, memories of his time in the pits returning to him. He pulled the pouch tight and stood. With amusement, he noticed a twisted form lying on the couple stones a short distance away.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1213s - 1221s]
The mangled remains of the hazekiller he'd thrown out the window. Celsier walked over and retrieved his coin pouch, with a tug of iron pulling.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1223s - 1233s]
