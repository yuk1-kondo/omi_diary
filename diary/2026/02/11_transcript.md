## 📝 Crew Agrees To Overthrow The Final Empire - 1d25f982-c223-4b5c-88a0-b9a5d22c7f69

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [0s - 12s]
I had to admit that she had never seen any poetry welcomed so happily by his men. Ah, Calcio sat toward the other side of the room. Clubs are evil too.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [15s - 24s]
So ever I absolutely though. Being able to break break five hours. Yeah. And so back into their chairs, Dachshund taking a seat at the same table.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [25s - 28s]
Are we to receive any explanation for your tardiness?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [37s - 50s]
Against the bar, scanning the room. When Calcior's eyes fell on Vin, he winked. Your brother, Ham said, Is Morse coming to the meeting? Kelsey and Daxson shared a look.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [52s - 65s]
Not tonight, Kelsey said. But he'll join the crew eventually. Vin studied the others. They were skeptical. Tension between Causir and his brother perhaps?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [66s - 75s]
Breeze raised his dueling cane, pointing the tip at Calcira. All right, Calciere. You have kept this secret from us for eight months now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [76s - 85s]
We know it's big. We know you're excited, and we're all properly annoyed at you for being so secretive. So why don't you just go ahead and tell us what it is?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [86s - 96s]
Calcio smiled. Then he stood up straight, waving a hand toward the dirty plain looking Eden. Gentlemen, meet your new employer.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [98s - 111s]
This was apparently quite a shocking statement. Him? Ham asked. Him? Kelsior said with an awed. What? Eden asked, speaking for the first time.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [112s - 122s]
You have trouble working with someone who actually has morals. It's not that, my dear man. Breeze said, setting his jeweling cane across his lap.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [122s - 133s]
It's just that. Well, I was under the stringer impression that you didn't like our types very much. I don't, Eden said flatly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [133s - 141s]
You're selfish, undisciplined, and you've turned your backs on the rest of the scar. You dress nicely, but on the inside, you're dirty as ash.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [142s - 157s]
Ham snorted. I can see already that this job is going to be great for crew morale. Then washed quietly, chewing on her lip. Was obviously a ska worker, probably a member of a forge or textile mill.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [158s - 168s]
What connection did he have with the underground? And how would he be able to afford the services of a thieving crew? Especially one as apparently specialized as Kelsier's team?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [169s - 178s]
Perhaps Kelsier noticed her confusion, for she found him looking at hers the others continued to speak. I'm still a little confused, Pam said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [179s - 193s]
Eden, we're all aware of how you regard Thieves. So why hire us? Eden squirmed a bit. Because, he finally said, everyone knows how effective you are.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [194s - 210s]
Breeze chuckled. Disapproving of our morals doesn't make you unwilling to make you of our skills, I see. So what is the job then? Or does the scar rebellion Scar Rebellion? Ben thought.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [211s - 220s]
A piece of the conversation falling into place. There were two sides to the underworld, the far larger portion was made up of the thieves, crews, whores, and beggars.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [221s - 229s]
Tried to survive outside of mainstream ska culture. And then there were the rebels. The people who worked against the final empire.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [230s - 244s]
Reen had always called them fools, a sentiment shared by most of the people, both underworlders and ska, that Vin had met. All eyes slowly turned to Celsier, who leaned back against the bar again.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [246s - 257s]
The Scar Rebellion, courtesy of its leader Yigen, has hired us for something very specific. What? Ham asked. Robbery? Assassination?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [258s - 272s]
A little of both, Kelsier said. And at the same time, neither one. Gentlemen, this isn't going to be a regular job. It's going to be different from anything, any crew has ever tried to pull.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [272s - 289s]
We're going to help Eaton overthrow the final empire. Silence. Excuse me? Ham asked. You heard me right, Ham, Kelseo said. That's the job I've been planning.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [290s - 303s]
The destruction of the final empire. Or at least its center of government. Eden has hired us to supply him with an army then provide him with a favorable opportunity to seize control of the city.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [304s - 307s]
Ham sat back, then shared a glance with Breeze.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [308s - 319s]
Both men turned toward Dachshund who nodded solemnly. The room remained quiet for a moment longer. Then the silence was broken as Eden began to laugh ruefully to himself.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [320s - 337s]
And I should never have to this. Eden said, shaking his head. Now that you say it, I realize how ridiculous it all sounds. Trust me, Eden, Kelcio said. These men have made a habit of pulling off plans that seemed ridiculous at first glance.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [339s - 344s]
That may be true, Cal, Bree said. But in this case, I find my

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [347s - 360s]
Overthrow the final empire. That is something that ska rebels have been working toward for a thousand years. What makes you think that we can achieve anything that those men have failed? Kelsey smiled.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [362s - 365s]
We'll succeed because we have vision, breeze.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [370s - 398s]
Yeden said indignantly. It's true, unfortunately, Kelsey said. The rebellion condemns people like us because of our greed. But for all their high morals, which, by the way, I respect, they never get anything done. Eden your men hide in woods and in hills, laughing how they'll someday rise up and meet a your kind has no idea how to develop and execute a proper plan.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [399s - 413s]
Eden's expression grew dark. And you have no idea what you are talking about. Oh? Said lightly. Tell me, has your rebellion accomplished during its thousand year struggle?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [414s - 422s]
Where are your successes and your victories? The massacre of Duger three centuries ago, where 7,000 scar rebels were slaughtered.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [422s - 432s]
The occasional rate of a traveling canal boat, or the kidnap of a minor and noble official. Eden flashed. That's the best we can manage with the people we have.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [433s - 443s]
Don't blame my men for their failures. Blame the rest of the scar. We can't ever get them to help. They've been beaten down for a millennium. They haven't got any spirit left.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [444s - 452s]
It's difficult enough to get one in a thousand to listen to us, let alone rebel. Peace, Eden, Chelsea said, holding up a hand.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [453s - 462s]
I'm not trying to insult your courage. We're on the same side. Remember? You came to me specifically because you were having trouble recruiting people for your army.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [463s - 475s]
I'm regretting that decision more and more, a thief. Said. Well, already paid us, Calcio said. So it's a little late to back out now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [475s - 483s]
But we'll get you that army, Eden. The men in this room are the most capable, most clever, and most skilled alamancers in the

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [486s - 500s]
The room grew quiet again. Vin sat at her table watching the interaction with a frown. What is your game, Kelsier? His words about overthrowing the final empire were obviously a front.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [501s - 510s]
It seemed most likely to her that he intended to scam the ska rebellion. But if he'd already been paid, then why continue the charade?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [512s - 522s]
Kelsier turned from Eden to breezed ham. Alright, gentlemen. What do you think? The two men shared a look. Finally, Breeze spoke.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [524s - 533s]
Lord Ruler knows I had never been one to turn down a challenge. But Kel, I do question your reasoning. Are you sure we can do this?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [534s - 543s]
I'm positive, Kelsier said. Previous attempts to overthrow the lord ruler have failed, but they lacked proper organization and planning.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [544s - 559s]
We're thieves, gentlemen, and we're extraordinarily good ones. We can rob the unrobbable and fool the unfoolable. We know how to take an incredibly large task and break it down to manageable pieces, then with each of those pieces.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [559s - 573s]
We know how to get what we want. These things make us perfect for this particular task. Breeze frowned. And how much are we getting paid for achieving the impossible?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [574s - 589s]
30,000 boxings, Eden said. Half now, half when you deliver the army. 30,000, Pam said, for an operation this big that will barely cover expenses.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [590s - 597s]
We'll need a spy among an ability to watch for rumors. We'll need a couple of safe houses, not to mention some place big enough to hide and train an entire army.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [598s - 608s]
No use haggling now, safe, Eden snapped. 30,000 may not sound like much to your type. It's the result of decades of saving on our part.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [608s - 617s]
We can't pay you more because we don't have anything more. It's good work, gentlemen, Dachshund noted, joining the conversation for the first time.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [618s - 631s]
Yes. Well, that's all great, briefed said. I consider myself a nice enough fellow. But this just seems a bit too altruistic. Not to mention stupid.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [632s - 645s]
Well, Calcius said, there might be a little bit more in it for us. Vin perked up, and Breeze smiled. The lord ruler's treasury, Kelseyor said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [646s - 657s]
The plan, as it stands now, is to provide with an army, an opportunity to seize the city. Once he takes the palace, he'll capture the treasury and use its funds to secure power.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [658s - 676s]
And central to that treasury, is the lord ruler's atrium. Breeze said. Kelsier nodded. Our agreement with Aden provides us of the ATIM reserves we find in the palace, no matter how vast they may be.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [678s - 690s]
Atium. Then it heard of the metal, but she never actually seen any. It was incredibly rare, supposedly used only by noblemen. Ham was smiling.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [691s - 703s]
Well, no, he said slowly. That's almost a big enough price to be tempting. That ATM stockpile is supposed to be enormous. Calcio said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [704s - 714s]
The Lord Ruler sells the metal only in small bits. Charging outrageous sums to the nobility. He has to keep a huge reserve of it to make certain he controls the market.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [715s - 726s]
To make certain he has enough wealth for emergencies. True, Breeze said. But are you sure you want to try something like this so soon after what

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [730s - 739s]
We're going to do things differently this time, Kelsey said. Gentlemen, be frank with you. This isn't going to be an easy job.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [740s - 749s]
But it can work. The plan is simple. We're going to find a way to neutralize the Luther Dell garrison. Leaving the area without a policing force.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [750s - 759s]
We're going to throw the city into chaos. We've got a couple of options on how to do that, Dachshund said. But we can talk about that later. Kelsior nodded.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [760s - 776s]
Then in that chaos, Eden will march his army into and seize the palace, taking the lord ruler prisoner. While Yiden secures the city, we'll pilfer the Atium. We'll give half to him, then disappear with the other half.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [777s - 789s]
After that, it's his job to hang on to what he's grabbed. Sounds a little dangerous for you, Eden. Ham noted, glancing at the rebel leader. He shrugged.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [789s - 799s]
Perhaps But if we do, by some miracle, end up in control of the then we'll have at least done something no ska rebellion has ever achieved before.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [800s - 811s]
For my men, this isn't just about riches. It isn't even about surviving. It's about doing something grand, wonderful to give the ska a hope.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [812s - 820s]
But I don't expect you people to understand things like that. Elsie shot a quieting glance at Eden, and the man sniffed and sat back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [822s - 831s]
Did he use alomancy? Then wondered She'd seen employer crew relationships before. It seemed that Eden was much more in Calcior's pocket than the other way around.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [833s - 846s]
Calcior turned back to Hammond Breeze. There's more to all this than simply a show of daring. If we manage to steal that atrium, it will be a sound blow to the Lord Ruler's financial foundation.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [846s - 862s]
He depends on the money that ATM provides. Without it, could very well be left without the means to pay his armies. Even if he escapes our trap or if we decide to take the city when he's gone to minimize having to deal with him, he'll be financially ruined.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [863s - 874s]
Won't be able to march soldiers in to take the city away from Eden. If this works right, we'll have the city in chaos anyway, and an ability will be too weak to react against the rebel forces.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [874s - 893s]
The lord ruler will be left confused and unable to mount a sizable army. And the coloss Hem asked quietly. Kelsier paused. If he marches those creatures on his own capital city, the destruction it would cause, could be even more dangerous than financial instability.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [894s - 902s]
In the chaos, the provincial nobleman will rebel and themselves up as kings. The lord ruler won't have the troops to bring him into line.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [902s - 915s]
Eden's rebels will be able to hold Lithadal and we, my friends. Will be very, very rich. Everyone gets what they want. You're forgetting the steel ministry.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [916s - 925s]
Clubs snapped, sitting almost forgotten at the side of the room. Those inquisitors won't just let us throw their petty into chaos.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [927s - 935s]
Kelcia paused, turning toward the gnarled man. We will have to find a way to deal with the ministry. I've got a few plans for that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [936s - 946s]
Either way, problems like that are the things that we as a crew will have to work out. We have to get rid of the lithodil garrison. There's no way we'll be able to get anything done with them.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [946s - 954s]
Policing the streets. We'll have to come up with an appropriate way to throw the city into chaos. And we'll have to find a way to keep the obligators off our trail.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [955s - 964s]
But if we play this right, we might be able to force the lord ruler to send the palace guard. Maybe even the inquisitors into the city to restore order.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [964s - 973s]
That will leave the palace itself exposed giving Eden a perfect opportunity to strike. After that, it won't matter what happens with the ministry or the garrison.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [974s - 985s]
The Lord Ruler won't have the money to maintain control of his empire. I don't know, Cal, Bree said. Shaking his head. His flippancy was subdued.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [985s - 994s]
Seemed to be honestly considering the plan. The lord ruler got that at him somewhere. What if he just goes in mine some more?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [995s - 1006s]
Ham nodded. No one even knows where the Atrium mine is. I wouldn't say no one. Said with a smile. Breeze and Ham shared a look.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1007s - 1021s]
You know? Ham asked. Of course, Kelsey said. I spent a year of my life working there. The pits? Am asked with surprise. Kelsior nodded.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1022s - 1026s]
That's why the lord ruler makes certain nobody survives working there.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1029s - 1045s]
It's not just a penal colony, not just a hellhole where scars sent to die. It's a mine. Of course, Breeze said. Kelsey stood up straight, stepping away from the bar and walking him and Breeze's table.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1046s - 1057s]
We have a chance here, gentlemen. Chance to do something great. Something no other thieving crew has ever done. We'll rob from the lord ruler himself.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1058s - 1070s]
But there's more. The pits nearly killed me. And I've seen things differently since I escaped. I see the ska working without hope.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1070s - 1078s]
I see the thieving crews trying to survive an aristocratic leavings. Often getting themselves and other ska killed in the process.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1079s - 1088s]
I see the ska rebellion trying so hard to resist the lord ruler and never may any progress. The rebellion fails because it's too unwieldy and spread out.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1089s - 1096s]
Anytime one of its many pieces gains momentum, the steel ministry crushes it. That's not the way to defeat the final empire, gentlemen.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1097s - 1112s]
But a small team specialized and skilled, has a hope. We can work without great risk of exposure. We know how to avoid the steel ministry's tendrils. We understand how the high nobility think and how to exploit its members.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1114s - 1126s]
We can do this. He paused beside Breeze and Ham's table. I know, Kel, Ham said. It's not that I'm disagreeing with your motives.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1127s - 1138s]
It's just that well, this seems a bit foolhardy. Kelsier smiled. I know it does. But you're going to go along with it anyway, aren't you?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1139s - 1149s]
Pam paused, then nodded. You know, I'll join your crew no matter what the job. This sounds crazy, but so do most of your plans.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1150s - 1161s]
Just just tell me. Are you serious about overthrowing the Lord Ruler? Kelsey nodded. For some reason, Ben was almost tempted to believe him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1162s - 1177s]
Ham nodded firmly. Alright then. I'm in. Breeze, Kelsira asked. The well dressed man shook his head. I'm not sure, Cal. This is a bit extreme.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1177s - 1199s]
Even for you. We need you, Breeze, Cal said. No one can sue the crowd like you can. If we're going to raise an army, we'll need your alamancers and your powers. Well, that much is true, Bree said. But even still, Calcior smiled, then he said something on the table.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1200s - 1209s]
The cup of wine Vin had poured for Breeze. She hadn't even noticed that Kelsier had it off of the bar. Think of the challenge breeze.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1209s - 1222s]
Said. Breeze glanced at the cup, then looked up at Finally, he laughed, reaching for the wine. Fine. I'm in. It's impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1223s - 1232s]
A gruff voice said from the back of the room. Clubs sat with folded arms regarding Kelsier with a scowl. What are you really planning, Kelsier?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1234s - 1246s]
I'm being honest, Celsier I plan to take the lord ruler's atrium and overthrow his empire. You can't, the man said. It's idiocy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1246s - 1261s]
The inquisitors will hang us all by hooks through our throats. Perhaps, Calcior said. But think of the reward if we succeed. Well, power, and a land where the scar can live like men.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1262s - 1273s]
Rather than slaves. Clubs snorted loudly. Then he stood, his chair toppling backward onto the floor behind him. No reward would be enough.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1274s - 1288s]
The lord ruler tried to have you killed once. I see that you won't be satisfied until he gets it right. With that, the older man turned and stopped in a limping gate from the room, slamming the door behind him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1289s - 1301s]
The lair grew quiet. Well, guess we need a different smoker, docks said. You're just going to let him go? You demand He knows everything.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1302s - 1311s]
Breeze chuckled. Aren't you supposed to be the moral one in this little group? Morals doesn't have anything to do with it, Eaton said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1311s - 1320s]
Letting someone go like that is foolish. He could bring the obligators down on us in minutes. Vin nodded in agreement, but Kelsier just shook his head.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1322s - 1335s]
I work that way, Eden. I invited clubs to a meeting where I outlined a dangerous plan. One some people might even call I'm not going to have him assassinated because he decided it was too dangerous.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1335s - 1347s]
If you do things like that, pretty soon nobody will come listen to your plans in the first place. Besides, Dachshund said, we wouldn't invite someone to one of these meetings unless we trusted him not to betray us.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1348s - 1372s]
Impossible, Ben thought from him. He had to be fluffing to keep up crew morale. Nobody was that trusting him. After all, having the others said that Jelsier's failure to review before the event that had sent him to the Pits Of Hathseny had come because of a betrayal He probably had assassin's father with the roadstick bearing moment, him make certain he didn't go to the authorities.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1374s - 1386s]
All right here, Kelsey has said, getting back to business. They accepted. The plan is on. Are you still in? Will you give the rebellions money back if I say no?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1386s - 1402s]
Eden asked. The only response to that was a quiet chuckle from Ham. Eaton's expression darkened, but he just shook his head. If I had any other option, Oh, stop complaining, Kelsey or said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1402s - 1415s]
You're officially part of a thieving crew now, so you might as well come over here and sit with us. Eden paused for a moment, then sighed and walked over to sit at ham, and dachshund's table beside which Elsayer was still standing.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1416s - 1431s]
Ben still sat at the next table over. Kelsey returned, looking over toward Ben. What about you, Ben? She paused. Why is he asking me? He already knows he has a hold over me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1431s - 1442s]
The job doesn't matter as long as I learn what he knows. Kelsey are waited expectantly. I'm in, Vince said, assuming that was he wanted to hear.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1443s - 1455s]
She must have guessed correctly, for Calciere smiled. Then nodded to the last chair at the table. Vin sighed, but did as he indicated, standing and walking over to take the last seat.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1456s - 1472s]
Who is the child? Eden asked. Twixt, Breeze said. Cassie cocked an eyebrow. Actually, Vin is something of a new recruit. My brother caught her soothing his emotions a few months back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1474s - 1485s]
Surgery? M asked. Guess we can always use another of those. Actually, Calcior noted, it seems she can riot people's emotions as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1487s - 1503s]
Started. Really? Ham asked. Kelceer nodded. Dunks and I tested her just a few hours ago. Brace chuckled. And here I was telling her that she'd probably never meet her mistborn beside yourself.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1505s - 1516s]
A second mistborn on the team, Am said appreciatively. Well, that increases our chances somewhat. What are you saying? Eaton spired.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1516s - 1527s]
Skye can't be mistborn. I'm not even sure if Mistborn exist. I've certainly never met one. Freeze raised an eyebrow. Lay the hand on hidden shoulder.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1528s - 1544s]
You should try not to talk so much, friend, he suggested You'll sound far less stupid that way. Shook off Brace's hand, and Han laughed. Then however, sat quietly considering the implications of what Kelsier had said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1545s - 1560s]
The part about stealing the ATIM reserves was tempting, but seizing the city to do it. Were these men really that reckless? Calcior pulled a chair over to the table for himself and down on it the wrong way, resting his arms on the seat back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1561s - 1573s]
Alright, he said. We have a crew. We'll plan specifics at the next meeting. But I want you all to be thinking about the job. I have plans, but I want fresh minds to consider our task.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1574s - 1582s]
Need to discuss ways to get the Lutherdale garrison out of the city. Ways that we can throw this place into so much chaos that the greenhouses can't mobilize their forces.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1582s - 1592s]
To stop Yidan's army when it attacks. Remember, of the group, say Eaton, nodded. Before we end for the evening, however, Kelsey continued.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1593s - 1607s]
There is one more part of the plan I want to warn you about. More? Bruce asked with a chuckle. Stealing the Lord Ruler's fortune and overthrowing his empire are enough. Calcio said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1608s - 1630s]
If I can, I'm going to kill him too. Silence. Kelsey, Ham said slowly. The lord ruler is the sliver of infinity. He's a piece of God himself. You can't kill him. Even capturing him will probably prove impossible.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1631s - 1644s]
Kelsier didn't reply. His eyes, however, were determined. That's it, Vin thought. He has to be insane. The lord ruler and I, Calcio said, quietly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1645s - 1657s]
We have an unsettled debt. He took mare from me, and he nearly took my own sanity as well. I'll admit to you all that part of my reason for this plan is to get revenge on him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1658s - 1665s]
We're going to take his government, his home, and his fortune from him. However, for that to work, we'll have to get rid of him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1665s - 1675s]
Perhaps imprison him in his own dungeons. At the very least, we'll have to get him out of the city. However, I can think of something far better than either option.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1676s - 1685s]
Down those pits where he sent me, I snapped and came to an awakening of my elemantic powers. Now I intend to use them to kill him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1687s - 1697s]
Calcia reached into his suit pocket and pulled something out. He set it on the table. In the North, they have a Calcior said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1698s - 1708s]
It teaches that the lord ruler isn't immortal. Not completely. They say he can be killed with the right metal. The eleventh medal.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1709s - 1725s]
That medal, Eyes turned toward the object on the table. It was a thin bar of metal, perhaps as long and wide as Vin's small with straight sides. It was so silvery white in color.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1726s - 1741s]
The eleventh metal breeze asked uncertainly. I've heard of no such legend. The Lord Ruler has it, Calcior said. But it can still be found if you know where to look.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1742s - 1755s]
Alomantic theory teaches of 10 medals, the eight basic medals, and the two high medals. There is another one, however, unknown to most, one far more powerful even than the other 10.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1756s - 1767s]
Breeze frowned skeptically. Eden, however, appeared intrigued. And this metal can somehow kill the lord ruler? Kelsior nodded.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1768s - 1777s]
It's his weakness. The steel ministry wants you to believe that he's immortal, even he can be killed by an alamance of running this.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1779s - 1792s]
Ham reached out, picking up the thin bar of metal. Where did you get it? In the North, Kelceo said. In a land near the Far Peninsula, a land where people still remember

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1797s - 1810s]
How does it work? Breeze asked. I'm not sure, Calcior said frankly. But I intend to find out. Em regarded the porcelain colored metal turning it over his fingers.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1811s - 1822s]
Kill the lord ruler, Ben thought. The lord ruler was a force like the winds of the mists. One did kill such things. They didn't live, really.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1823s - 1840s]
They simply were. Regardless, Calcior said, accepting the little back from him, You don't need to worry about this. Killing the lord ruler is my task. If it proves impossible, we'll settle for tricking him outside the city, then rob him silly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1841s - 1855s]
I just thought you should know what I'm planning. I've bound myself to a mad man, Ben thought But that didn't really matter. Not as long as he taught her alomancy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1858s - 1868s]
I don't even understand what I'm The terrorist philosophers claim that I'll know my duty when the time comes. But that's a small comfort.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1869s - 1883s]
The deepness must be destroyed. And apparently, I'm the only one who can do so. It ravages the world even now. If I don't stop it soon, there will be nothing left of this land but bones and dust.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1887s - 1890s]
Five Uh-huh.
