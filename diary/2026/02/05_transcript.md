🎤 SPEAKER_6 [10s - 11s]
Worst reporter.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [38s - 64s]
No Four years, Wayfair was selling furniture with the same name as missing girls. For example, in 2019, a 17 year old girl from Ohio named Samaya went missing. Then a few days later, Wayfair listed a Samaya five shelf store cabinet for almost $13,000. In 2020, a 16 year old girl from Connecticut named Yuritza went missing.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [65s - 120s]
A few days later, the Yuritza storage cabinet went up for sale on Wayfair for just under $14,000. May 2020 from Kansas City, a year old girl named Annabelle goes missing. Same storage unit sold on Wayfair. Annabelle with the same selling for just under $11,000. January 2020, Kyla Coleman, 16 year olds from Cleveland goes missing. You can already guess, Wayfair, same name, This one discounted for 12,000. Everyone always calls this a conspiracy theory until now when a receipt from Wayfair was found in the Epstein files. Look. We know that Jeffrey Epstein's network has a history with missing girls. Don't forget this picture of John Benny Ramsey and Ghislaine Max lurking in the background. At the receipt, it was purchased by Karina, Jeffrey Epstein's long time girlfriend, on 06/28/2018.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [121s - 129s]
It was for one item totaling $8,400. And I've tried, but I can't find out what the item was.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [129s - 152s]
What I do know is that on June 23, five days prior, a girl named Joanna went missing from Columbus, Ohio. And still, to this day, she has never been found. But back in the day when this conspiracy was spreading online, there was a high priced Joanna cabinet search circulating in the chats from the same WFX utility company.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [152s - 189s]
Just for context, the WFX company is still selling the same storage units on Wayfair, but they're only a $139. Jeffrey Epstein's girlfriend, Karina, wasn't just making purchases on Wayfair. She's also active in the files for making purchases off of of Etsy. We know that back during this time, Etsy also had some very weird postings. The reality is is that none of this proves anything, but it does make you think that if this type of activity was half who was behind selling these items to Jeffrey and his network allegedly?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [190s - 213s]
Where's Epstein's longtime girlfriend, Karina? She was a dentist dentist, which might explain why he had these rooms just two days before his passing, his estate signed everything over to her. We're talking about the properties, Zorro Ranch, the island, and hundreds of millions of dollars. So does she know where all the bodies are Four year

One to 11. Yeah. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [476s - 480s]
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the will of God and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is at Corinth.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [483s - 498s]
With all the saints who in the whole of Achair. Grace to you and from God, our father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all affliction.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [499s - 506s]

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [507s - 516s]

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [581s - 584s]
help us by prayer so that many will give thanks on our of the blessing granted us to prayers of many.

👤 あなた [592s - 613s]
Okay. Thank you. So second, Corinthians there. It has approved proved attractive to scholars on the basis of some critical and interpretive issues will briefly in touch with some of these.

👤 あなた [615s - 618s]
But I I think for us,

👤 あなた [622s - 642s]
I think for us, works much more interesting, I'm sure, and helpful about ternobyte This letter would be its usefulness and pastoral document As Porter says, this identifies insights.

👤 あなた [643s - 673s]
Into your highly apostle Paul adjusted his perspective on a church that continually seemed to be involved in some type of controversy even if we are not in tactly certain role that that controversy entailed to ensure that continually to know any churches like that.

👤 あなた [674s - 687s]
But in many ways, I suppose, we we pray there aren't the big big blow ups. Too often, I can't can't eat the church split some.

👤 あなた [688s - 699s]
Things like that. But there's always something, I'd imagine, in in a church of any any size. And, therefore, this letter is very helpful.

👤 あなた [700s - 719s]
For us. It is much to say between ministers abides gospel. Ministry, So how would you summarize this? Now the message of second Corinthians, anyone?

👤 あなた [729s - 732s]
With a with a desire to see it as a single document.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [733s - 770s]
I appreciated for women's It's about reconciliation. Reconciliation worked out through or implied maybe by assignments to fulfill financial bench eight to nine and then I work both both getting rid of faults of bottles at 10 to 13 and implicitly recalibrating their way of assessing what the true opposites. So reconciliation is point but it works out in these practical ways.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [773s - 774s]
Yes.

👤 あなた [774s - 790s]
Right. So this is a key point. Any any obsessed with it as more biographical in a way.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [795s - 805s]
There seems to be a great appeal for the apostle that to reject the apostle Paul in weakness and his proclamation is to reject Christ himself.

👤 あなた [816s - 837s]
Yes. And, yep, I think he's he's got perhaps what would be compared to some of the stuff that's the current teams have been hearing a a counterintuitive way of of of doing that and of asserting his his authority.

👤 あなた [849s - 888s]
Okay. So I'm paraphrasing Gordon here, basically. Paul versus his own soul. And the soul of the gospel to the Corinthians. He does this to promote reconciliation between himself and them, and to exhort them to be reconciled to God The end result will be cross shaped ministry, by both himself and David has fleshed out the specifics of that a little bit from chapter eight to nine. Now Generosity, chapter 10 to 13.

👤 あなた [889s - 914s]
You know, how these superimposals or falseimposals are in some ways, threatening the relationship with with with Paul. And as it goes much more fundamentally, distorting the gospel, So firstly then, historical and critic issues.

👤 あなた [916s - 972s]
So we'll briefly consider authorship, holds correspondence with the Corinthians, and the unity of two Corinthians. So the authorship them So like one Corinthians, even the most critical stars attribute this matter of the call. There's some discussion of the you know, they have the letter, which we will come back to. But there's little the impulse correspondence with the Corinthians So from what you're read and the hints within the letters themselves and what you've read and then the literature. How how many times did Paul write to the Corinthians that we come that that that we know of, and do you think, Omi?

👤 あなた [976s - 977s]
We did four times.

👤 あなた [980s - 993s]
Yeah. Four times seems to be the simplest way to construct it. Some might try to make a kiss for five. The argument seems a bit more comfortable with them.

👤 あなた [994s - 1023s]
That's not to say. You can allude to them both of times. You know? But but in terms of what evidence we have and what is most significant in terms of the content of one or two current sales. We we can think about four ladders, I think, So it is somewhat complex, the dealing of current areas regardless of how we reconstruct the interchange of flatteries in the mid fifties.

👤 あなた [1025s - 1041s]
There were at least four laterties changed colon and the current theme. So there was the original lost letter. After the church was founded, around fifty two AD, which prompted various questions from the church.

👤 あなた [1042s - 1061s]
Which called out rest along with other concerns, one Corinthians, They're then following a painful visit chapter two verse one second Corinthians. For I made up am I not to make another painful visit. To you?

👤 あなた [1064s - 1082s]
And a severe latter followed that. There's a lot of questions also lost to chapter two verse two to four. For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad, but the one whom I have been? And I wrote as I did.

👤 あなた [1082s - 1090s]
So that when I came, I might not suffer pain, from those who should have made me rejoice I found sure all of you

👤 あなた [1094s - 1129s]
For I felt sure of all of you that my joy would be the joy of yours. For I note you as much of fiction as anguish upon and as many tears, not because of the you know the abundant that I have for you. So that's not the first one was written subsequently And then we have two different things. The low the this the letter referred to in chapter two.

👤 あなた [1129s - 1156s]
Here was the urge strongly, the discipline of the defender, who, it appears, as strong as it was this matter, a broad demand concern that the majority of the Guernsey has two with infants and the degree of reconciliation with whole So chapter two, verse five till 11. Chapter seven, verse two to 16.

👤 あなた [1157s - 1161s]
Would would probably be what the tax rate to kind of factor that up.

👤 あなた [1166s - 1181s]
No. Someone see chapter 10 to 13 as an interpolation. From a different ladder due to the more severe toe. We see he's quite concili conciliatory.

👤 あなた [1182s - 1210s]
In chapters one to nine, and he he asked him for money in chapters eight and nine. The the thinking might be, well, why then would he go off on them and 10 to 13 if he wants to to to get the money? But but but Paul probably didn't think in the kind of smooth business he took place that that that we tend to do.

👤 あなた [1213s - 1223s]
I think it necessarily follow While there has been a measure of reconciliation with all, there are still these so called suprarapoxals around.

👤 あなた [1224s - 1238s]
They offer a triumphal message that appear to denoquent Paul's apparent weakness. They also have considerable influence and would seek to steal coals sheep.

👤 あなた [1238s - 1266s]
So the final four chapters therefore, they look strongly with this issue. So I suppose that seems logical enough to say there's a lot of reconciliatory and war manage, however, is challenge to a challenge one to nine. But then he said, but Gavdas, you need to watch out for these guys. You know?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1267s - 1268s]
You need to not be there.

👤 あなた [1272s - 1299s]
So Paul wrote at least four hours to me. Parentheums, two of which will be lost, We assume the unity of both harmonical levers but it's not to deny that there may have been other letters between Poland currents and it would hardly be surprising if these were ever found if there was not some overlap of content

👤 あなた [1303s - 1320s]
Now there is a question that's somebody has a bump. You don't need it happen. Dealt with it in relation to chapters 10 to 13, but chapter six fourteen to seven one, which in itself, is a very rich kind of tone.

👤 あなた [1321s - 1356s]
Passage. I think I'll think it's a gold's carbonant, a gold dwelling with his people and so forth. With a kind of since we have these promises on the polls grid, therefore, if you like it, chapter seven verse one, no Some would say go perhaps, either a part of poles, first loss letter or one of the other letters because they they break up the flow of second Corinthians.

👤 あなた [1359s - 1370s]
So what did you what do you make of that claim? You think answer this?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1376s - 1392s]
It struck me it struck me that it's similar to textatrical arguments that if you come to a text and it looks like somebody's inserted something that doesn't block, you have to ask yourself, well, why might they have done that?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1392s - 1446s]
And it's it's often the most unlikely the the the most humanly unlikely option is is the one you should be inclined to a firm because if there isn't a good argument for it, then it's more likely be genuine. And, actually, if you so I I can see how it does how the flow does run nicely from six thirteen to seven two. But that just makes me think, well, so why is he why is he inserting that there? He's talking about striking that he's talking so much about tabernacle, temporal, language and God coming and making his dwelling. And and, actually, they do need to get a well, don't they? They they he he he is talking about the same thing. He's making breaking into an illustration to talk about the signature of what it means that God should make his dwelling with us, but it's not a different Yep.

👤 あなた [1458s - 1460s]
Any anything for you?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1470s - 1486s]
Yeah. I was pretty much gonna see what David just said on on the surface. It does look like a abrupt breaking of the flow of thought. But it's it's from what I gather, it's typical Pauline kind of style. Anyway, he often digresses.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1487s - 1524s]
What what appears to be digressions, but often a deepening or an expansion of the main the main points he's making But, yeah, I I can but I can can see I see I can see what I can see what people are saying there. But from my understand that I kinda were particularly where I read it this week, but it was kinda like there's no textual kind of manuscript variance of of this that that we have. So it's not like it's disputed But like what we talked about with one Corinthians, was it four eleven last week?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1525s - 1532s]
There's there's none of that to be to be added to this. So it it seems you can't there's no arguments to be made from that side of things.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1533s - 1537s]
So a typical Pauline, regret, kind of digress, but potentially,

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1539s - 1540s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1540s - 1541s]
Related nonetheless.

👤 あなた [1542s - 1590s]
Yeah. I I think the point about least likely, you know, it it isn't important because as this was in an epidural, we wanted to say something and search something even even say, imagining and it's with the with the best of intentions as well to you know, kind of this wasn't authentically Pauline paragraph, and they want to make sure it's in there somewhere, but it wasn't found there is no letter. Well, this this may not necessarily be the place that that that you would do. Can't think of hand where you would put it, but But, you know, this wouldn't necessarily be the place.

👤 あなた [1591s - 1617s]
So so, you know, that suggests it's a scientific when you're the whole it isn't like one of our digress probably. That's may or may not play very relevant and helpful to the overall flow of a a sermon on an essay, but it's more, you know, all those those what he's doing. It's like he's not he's not mechanical in that sense.

👤 あなた [1618s - 1633s]
And we see it in you know, Philippines one, five to eight. Seems to break up a continuous flow that first nine would pick up. We see it in Ephesians chapter three, probably the first half of that.

👤 あなた [1633s - 1648s]
Chapter, you know, where he's he says, well, one, two, pray for you. For this reason, I have bought Prisoner for Jesus Christ on behalf of you Gentiles.

👤 あなた [1649s - 1661s]
Buy my knees before the father. That's Ephesians three one and Ephesians three fourteen. So that's that that that's a bit smooth. I just put any of the dot.

👤 あなた [1661s - 1693s]
Verse two to 13 is something of a digression, but it is an extremely good digression. And fits into the overall argument of of the matter. So it is a nondral thing. It is a it isn't sloppiness, but same time, Paul isn't just simply governed by perfect style.

👤 あなた [1695s - 1702s]
You know? Okay. He's finished chapter two of Ephesians verse 22 talking about the household of God being built

👤 あなた [1708s - 1719s]
And then he said then he was allowing to write this one up. What he's praying for it, but when they start saying that, but then he goes, oh, yes. And there's all this as well. And, you know, that's your human.

👤 あなた [1719s - 1725s]
But it's it's it's only the inspiration of the the the Holy Spirit.

👤 あなた [1730s - 1744s]
So so in other words, that six fourteen to seven one standalone wherever it can be not part of second Corinthians.

👤 あなた [1749s - 1758s]
So five nine of second Corinthians then. Very briefly on this.

👤 あなた [1761s - 1775s]
So there is three main sections, chapters one and the seven. Chapters yet to nine, and chapters 10 to 13. So in the theme of chapters one to seven, time acting and falls rejoicing at their repentance.

👤 あなた [1776s - 1807s]
In chapter seven is reconciliation. Chapter three of the nine, call it searching, the Corinthians to forward a collection which they appeared eager to make to the mother church in Jerusalem But somehow had not quite followed through on their initial zero for that. So it's ready to encourage them to to do that.

👤 あなた [1813s - 1824s]
And I mean, it's a fairly easy kind of reading the compound sort of question. I suppose, but how does it call make the appeal of generosity in chapters you have in mind?

👤 あなた [1825s - 1831s]
This thing would be Christian. Do you think how does he base it in the the gospel.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1845s - 1873s]
I find him austinating in how he's calling believers to give as their hearts would lead them. Which is very different. And I don't know where the question question whether the question is going to be that in the Old Testament giving was a man debt to give 10% of whatever you had.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1874s - 1887s]
But over here, it seems not to lay a big a huge burden on them to tell them how much they also give that they they ought to give from their heart understanding the generosity.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1887s - 1894s]
Of God through his son, Jesus Christ. So that that makes it this thing requested.

👤 あなた [1898s - 1913s]
Yep. So and and somehow, the letters are the the chapters are a little bit complex to lead, not the subject of art, not in terms of the style, but but it's beautiful.

👤 あなた [1913s - 1942s]
Grinding and chapter eight verse nine. And you know the grace of all of Jesus Christ, that though he was redshed for your might become rich and I mean, that's great standalone tax day, a a a submission of the gospel but think about it in its context, obviously.

👤 あなた [1943s - 1953s]
And you'll see you'll see that the appeal of the generosity is so much more advanced as we what we think on that.

👤 あなた [1956s - 1960s]
And I got chapter nine verse eight, so eight nine nine eight.

👤 あなた [1971s - 1984s]
Every good work so the Lord loves a cheerful different reasons of the Israelites. What by which you ought to be cheerful

👤 あなた [1988s - 2067s]
So do her. Obvious examples of reassembly of getting and yes, boss, wispons that will question then of how much comes into that. If you understand the fuller revelation of grace, you can you you can be much more much more generous. So some would say well, 10% is a starting point, but I I'm I'm not sure it's as simple as that someone could actually technically for various reasons, hopefully, due to need and financial constraint get somewhat less than 10%, but but they're giving from their heart and they are serving not just with their their treasure, but with their time, talent, doing so joyfully. But you know, don't necessarily put me on that. But, you know, at I think that is the spirit of the gospel as trying general that that that we see here.

👤 あなた [2069s - 2080s]
Then chapters ten fifteen, deal with the ongoing issue of self proclaimed. Super apostles who sent themselves over against haul.

👤 あなた [2081s - 2106s]
On the basis that he is not sufficiently impressive or maybe it is okay to become a Christian to get people converted. But you know, in terms of them going on, having greater experience and greater power that need something else. You need the message that that that they are bringing.

👤 あなた [2109s - 2149s]
So the bit surrounds are identally. And they're distinctive aspect aspects with Goron think it most likely that their Jewish background isn't Paul's concern in this instance, but that they may see themselves as a spirit filled elite and we see certainly how seriously call ticks the threat. So superopposals is the language used in the ESV translation. I consider that I am not in the release.

👤 あなた [2149s - 2188s]
Inferior to these super apostles in the previous verse then. Says, for if someone comes to preach Jesus, than the one we proclaimed or if you receive a different spirit from the one we proclaimed receive or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you cut off with it gradually enough. So the so these teachers were gaining traction with with the people, their relationship with Paul, was under threat, and Paul was quite clear to knowing Jesus.

👤 あなた [2189s - 2193s]
It is a different gospel

👤 あなた [2197s - 2218s]
And that doesn't mean that they really clean, obviously. Not those are other. Another man about Jesus and they're following him. It doesn't mean that there weren't aspects of the the true gospel in their message, but but but the distortions were so so severe that Paul viewed it in that way.

👤 あなた [2220s - 2230s]
Until eleven thirteen. To 15. For such men are false supposed to seek forward men. Disguising themselves as opposals of Christ.

👤 あなた [2231s - 2250s]
And no wonder for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of life. So there's no surprise if his servants also disguise themselves servants of righteousness, their realm will correspond to their deeds.

👤 あなた [2254s - 2271s]
And then 12 of them Her eye was not a total inferior to these supraposals even though I am nothing. So Paul sees the threat of these appointments and it's deadly. So serious.

👤 あなた [2275s - 2276s]
Okay. Any comments or questions?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2296s - 2304s]
You can imagine responding to that by saying, let's talk about the gospel, which he does do, but he talked about

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2326s - 2330s]
Interesting that that's similar.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2331s - 2336s]
The book of Galatians, the word that he defends his gospel by defending the way he received it. And the authenticity of that reception.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2337s - 2351s]
Strengthly, that's quite similar that his credentials are his weakness in receiving undeserving Odivos. And in that, it's proved to be genuine, but he's not he's not commending him. He's commending him an s.

👤 あなた [2360s - 2368s]
Yeah. Good. Okay. Well, that's me going. Why was second letter?

👤 あなた [2372s - 2397s]
So it would appear that the occupational second criticisms is similar but somewhat different. To first Corinthians. While much of the fractionalism in that bladder has been overcome, New opponents have entered that they are very persuasive.

👤 あなた [2399s - 2424s]
They're questioning Paul's authority through personal attack through claiming to be warned for a partly than full. Like to claim legitimately or probably otherwise that the authority of the Jewish or church, and you can see quarter on that.

👤 あなた [2427s - 2469s]
So lying behind there, I there was a similar kind of fraud thinking that we find in long term. So the overrealized eschatology the mature focus on the more spectacular So Paul is particularly concerned that the Corinthian Christians do not fall for their old teaching because he knows them. He knows this might be a particular temptation for them

👤 あなた [2475s - 2479s]
Now I what do you think, God, that pastoral lessons here?

👤 あなた [2483s - 2494s]
We learn from Paul's concern about the superimposals, particularly in their threats. To the Corinthian quest Christians, any any thoughts on that?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2511s - 2513s]
Yeah. The grand wall all one who you follow.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2522s - 2541s]
So it's all all well over presenting a message that's persuasive and defensible. That is important. But people follow somebody. They trust somebody or they trust people. And so there are these impressive figures who come along, and they are a danger to the chair.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2541s - 2602s]
I mean, this is Ezekiel, and Jesus talking about shepherds. And it was all over the place that the the people that are in positions of spiritual authority have their capacity to lead others astray because that's just how that's how this works. And so the pastor lived in an age where the Internet is full of legitimate looking sources of spiritual guidance that I would say one significant posture of implication is that pastors or churches are called to reaffirm a significant of the pastoral office as here's an individual that the lord has has has given you or an eldership that the notice has given you to to care for you, not just by delivering the words that you yourself regardless as comprehensible as that is the swest.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2602s - 2607s]
A there's a leadership responsibility being emphasized and underlined here.

👤 あなた [2613s - 2621s]
Yeah. So you're setting up then. Part of that is to deal with deal with the other stuff, the other influences of my think so much about because we think we're all we think we're individualistic

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2635s - 2641s]
We think we're all in charge of what we think and stuff. But, actually, in reality, we're not. We're all following something.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2643s - 2651s]
Are much less discerning about who we're in trouble. We've got this Yeah. Mirage of being in charge of ourselves.

👤 あなた [2655s - 2657s]
Yeah. So, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2660s - 2678s]
Just thinking about Gary, about how this kind of connects into the warnings from one Corinthians. The previous letter, where where Paul in one Corinthians three is talking about about leaders and those who truly try to build the church in good faith but fail.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2678s - 2687s]
Who their works are burnt up, but they themselves will be saved. But then he goes on to say, if anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2687s - 2701s]
And I feel like a little bit like the the super apostles are actually servants of Satan preaching a different gospel. So they're not there in good faith. They're they're not miss misinformed. They're intentionally trying to mislead.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2702s - 2714s]
God's people. And so it's a to answer your question, it's a it's a Paul considers this a a a very serious threat, because it's a different gospel. In fact, agents of of Satan.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2715s - 2763s]
And and so for him, it's it seems to me like it's a it's a very serious problem. One where Paul's previously warned them about, okay, Talking about internal threats perhaps, but if not learned the lesson there, And so it's kinda like it's it's it's yeah. It's it's pretty serious, but god if it's almost like the analogy of if you're trying to if you're a bit of a if you're a a dodgy a cowboy builder versus somebody who's like a demolition crew. So if you build the house a bit wonky, gonna be alright. But if you come in to try and destroy the church, then God's gonna destroy you, Paul says. So it seems to me they fit in that second category.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2764s - 2766s]
And so need to be dealt with quite severely.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2773s - 2791s]
What's also interesting is how the apostle grounds it back into the garden, predicate in verse, each chapter 11. Verse verse three, and the seeing these superposals who are coming and are turning around the gospel.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2792s - 2838s]
They're they're like the serpent deceived. Mhmm. And with that, kind of cleverness. What what's interesting with and with the word super, I kind of use cultural lenses in where we are and seeing how these kind of super apostles are calling themselves prophets are changing. The real Jesus who died on the cross or suffered for our sin, and that's earning it to be an easy beliefism kind of message, one that does require you to repent and turn around. And and and this is a reminder that we need to stand bomb on what is true and rebuke such evil preaching in our midst.

👤 あなた [2847s - 2857s]
Yeah. And that's that you know, sometimes, I mean, they they seem to be clear. I don't know how to call them kite boys or demolition.

👤 あなた [2858s - 2860s]
Crew, but, yeah, probably demolition crew.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2863s - 2866s]
I think there's a bit of a a spectrum, you know, There can be those who are some serial motor pillars.

👤 あなた [2874s - 2885s]
They genuinely want to be teaching the gospel and edifying the the believers. There's a bit quite a bit of truth in what they say.

👤 あなた [2885s - 2904s]
Error in them as well. So how you deal with them is someone different than how you would deal with those. We are we are clearly out to undermine the well, in this case, the apostle himself, but the opposite stoic teaching that we have.

👤 あなた [2904s - 2938s]
In in subtle ways. There is subtle But I think I think a general pastoral lesson as well as Paul is addressing the problem of the current figure, He's dealing with a particular church and it can be easy for us, I suppose, to find something wacky and attack it to your mom. You're finding the most extreme thing that you can from a somewhere in the Internet. It's like, look at what these people are are doing.

👤 あなた [2939s - 2967s]
Do that. And that's never going to be something that your people are are likely to do. But But but what are the arrows facing facing your people, What are the sins and arrows in our own churches? Lives Subgovernment is helpful in highlighting the ultimate focus of the chronoformship of life and Christ.

👤 あなた [2968s - 2982s]
But that is the unified theme of second Corinthians. There are differences in style, three octal matter, As we've mentioned, chapters one to seven are considering a 38 tonight.

👤 あなた [2982s - 3002s]
Exorcator, exam the 13, polemical. But the needs for Christians to the cross centered lines unifies the whole and that is at the heart of the passage we go.

👤 あなた [3002s - 3018s]
We will might look at. Okay. So we'll we'll break there. We'll have a look at. Now at 11:30 to to twelve. Pounds were Paul is taking on the the the suburb postholes.

👤 あなた [3018s - 3029s]
Head on. Okay. Any questions, comments before we break? Okay. Good. Let's pick it up at town then. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [3029s - 3030s]
Thank you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3080s - 3082s]
No greater name.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [0s - 1s]
Well, clearly, that's not right.

👤 あなた [3s - 4s]
Thing is it?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [114s - 130s]
And you think that in order to get to a robust confidence in inspiration, you need to be confident that it was poor who penned them. And I guess a large extent that he had them in disticks.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [131s - 131s]
Well,

👤 あなた [132s - 140s]
Well, yeah, I mean, I think I think I will do get from the problem. Pendom and and

👤 あなた [143s - 154s]
And and and, yeah, that's sympathy for the the the the first part in in in the sense of okay. On with that kind of thing. Yeah. Certainly for

👤 あなた [159s - 168s]
certainly for pretain purposes and so forth. I think there's need to just accept and get on with. But, you know, it's good to good to understand.

👤 あなた [169s - 223s]
I think the wider question would be I think, I suppose, some fundamentals in particular over the earth, everything in the gospels and so forth. So, you know, the the the they would almost make things happen five or six times in order to try to to harmonize everything. You know? You know, you read a bit like in Penning Peningtones with reading the gospels by saying about about this sort of thing, and he he he critiques that approach in it. But I think, you know, if it's making a historical or scientific statement somewhere, they're writing as people of the that time. The historical standards of that time, way of telling the time of that time, you know, whether it's something's happening in the third order or the sixth order so on.

👤 あなた [223s - 231s]
So forth. If you're somewhere in between those two times, you know, nine in the morning and twelve in the afternoon, and the sun's well up. You know?

👤 あなた [232s - 279s]
Yeah. You know, you could you you could go either way, and that's not that that that's not a big a a big issue, I think. So I would want to avoid a kind of complete sort of fundamentalist tendency to try and tie up every single dissent and then to pine yourself and not sitting in in the process. I mean, so but at the same time, I would want to you know, say, well, look. This is even even in responsible English translation, this is the text that we have, and we've got to work with that, and we can be confident in it.

👤 あなた [282s - 324s]
And and It's interesting. Gideon. So I I have a Gideon. CXP mutational there becomes that was there. And they had put these sort of disputed texts back in back into the main main tool of the text, Trevor, then then then the signal, they will and and in some ways, I think, well, I have a certain amount of sympathy for that because ordinary bible readers reading their the kind of translation most people use, NIV, ESV, or whatever.

👤 あなた [325s - 346s]
They suddenly see if they're paying attention, there's a verse 30 now. There's a verse 38, but there's no verse 37. And then they see a little fit note in I wonder what's what's going on there. But at the same time, I I recognize that those are invalid valid issues, and there's nothing in in stolen caution, think.

👤 あなた [346s - 368s]
Said there's nothing in that. The the shorter tax that we use off the damn which we basically MOV or the ESC on the attractive tax. But, you know, that would we will get every doctor, every every historical episode there as faithfully related as we do in the land.

👤 あなた [369s - 409s]
In the majority order tax just the and so forth. Yeah. I think so. So yeah, sometimes, besides I remember I I once was greatly I've reached as a when I discovered that if thou believest, thou mayest. Was missing from the the the NIV. You know? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [420s - 421s]
But Yeah.

👤 あなた [430s - 450s]
But And there's also a very staunch back this was a congregation of church, you know, the FCC, but, typically, no real strong confessionalism. So it was just practiced by default realism. Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [451s - 455s]
But I but, you see, I didn't know all of them, so I felt like, Well, no.

👤 あなた [465s - 468s]
Even but but but but, I mean, most sense sensible about this.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [468s - 470s]
So we can believe that too. So yeah.

👤 あなた [478s - 492s]
Sorry. I'm just a minute. But that should be hard to think if you're going Okay. So let's come down to second currency $11.30 to $12.10.

👤 あなた [502s - 510s]
So second, the credentials are weapon first. 30. Would someone like to read that final counter connection to 11, please?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [519s - 529s]
If I must first, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. The garden father of the Lord Jesus, the blessed forever knows that I am not lying.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [530s - 540s]
At Damascus, the governor under King Arytus was guarding the city of Damascus. In order to seize me. I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.

👤 あなた [543s - 545s]
Okay. First one beside somebody.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [550s - 565s]
Chapter twelve one to five, Gary. Yeah. I'll go for that. I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I'll go on to to visions and revelations of the Lord.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [566s - 575s]
I know a man in Christ who, fourteen years ago, was caught up to the third heaven, whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know. God knows.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [575s - 582s]
And I know this I know that this man was caught up into paradise. Whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know God knows.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [583s - 595s]
And he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. On behalf of this man, I will boast. But on my own behalf, will not boast except of my weakness.

👤 あなた [600s - 600s]
Panel now.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [608s - 609s]
Yeah. We do.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [612s - 624s]
Though if I should wish to boast, I will not be a fool. But I'd be speaking the truth. But I'll learn from it so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or ears for me.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [625s - 649s]
To keep me from becoming conceited because of the superson of the revelations, that born was given to me in the flesh. The messenger of Satan to harass to keep me from becoming conceited, Three times, they pleaded with the Lord about this, that he should believe and he said to him, my grace is sufficient to you.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [649s - 673s]
For my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly for my weaknesses. Without the power of Christ, may rest upon the saints of Christ then I am content with weakness, insults, hardships, persecution, and calamities. When I am weak.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [674s - 675s]
Then I am wrong.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [679s - 680s]
Okay. Thank you.

👤 あなた [682s - 717s]
In light of the opponents Paul is dealing with in second chapter eleven thirty and twelve ten, get to the heart. Of the message that Paul wishes to convey to the church there and to us Paul, who has had encounters with Chris that these super apostles know nothing of yet the predominant theme of

👤 あなた [720s - 730s]
Paul's life. Is how God's strength has come amid his weakness.

👤 あなた [734s - 752s]
So we'll think then about the contacts That's basically about boosting paradoxical boosting if you like. So we'll think about the context reason, priority, and object.

👤 あなた [754s - 771s]
Of Paul's boosting here And obviously, about several questions along the way So Paul says the first one, I must do all those novel is the the word day in Greek.

👤 あなた [776s - 790s]
Emphasizing necessity It is necessary for me to go on boosting So hope I remembered correctly, David's just checking. No. It'll be funny. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [790s - 791s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [791s - 791s]
Yeah.

👤 あなた [794s - 804s]
So from the context, do you think? What is the nature of the boosting that Paul refers to in one?

👤 あなた [810s - 812s]
Or the contact stuff is boosting. Lotsy boosting in

👤 あなた [824s - 830s]
So you could go right back in the chapter eleven six following if you wish. Nothing boosting a bite.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [834s - 844s]
It seems to be the the the privilege or that he res reseniors. Seeing visions and revelations of the Lord.

👤 あなた [847s - 852s]
Yeah. He goes on that in chapter 12. What do people off previously?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [862s - 863s]
The sufferings Yeah.

👤 あなた [864s - 866s]
The sufferings.

👤 あなた [870s - 889s]
Yeah. So in the previous versus, particularly from eleven sixteen onwards, Paul was boosting in his sufferings Generally, we we see a lot of things here. We don't have any other account of in the New Testament, so it's quite fascinating, really.

👤 あなた [892s - 896s]
How that how that all works out. I I think things were told rather.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [900s - 906s]
So he says how about the superimposals?

👤 あなた [906s - 916s]
Verse 23? Owner thy servants of Christ, I am a better one. I'm talking that I can a madman. With far greater neuters, far more imprisoned with countless speeds.

👤 あなた [918s - 931s]
And often they are dead. Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the 40 lashes less, one Again, I don't think we're told in lakhs or other letters that the details offer.

👤 あなた [932s - 947s]
Three times I was speaking with roads. One I was stoned, Was that in the stripper? Times I was shipwrecked, mean, one shipwrecked. For a night, and a day, I was at least at sea.

👤 あなた [948s - 989s]
On frequent journey names and injured from rivers, injured from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from jerkins, danger in the danger in the wilderness, dangerous sea, danger from false brothers, so he is immigrating these things on, of course, it goes against much of what it probably teach to me giving a list of virtuous sufferings or something like that and and boasting in that sense. But he is underlining the kind of boosting that that the the cerebral puzzles are are doing

👤 あなた [993s - 1015s]
And then we come to the first study. And it's argued by the likes of Murray Harris and Douglas Moore that eleven thirty to twelve ten for one section giving two examples of cause weakness. So his boast is in his weakness.

👤 あなた [1020s - 1030s]
So Harness comments This is the big Greek text commentary. He on the lesson therapy that acknowledged human weakness. Is the sin of Christ's power

👤 あなた [1034s - 1044s]
So Paul then puts himself in both, verse 31, the God and power of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is blessed forever knows I am not lying.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1045s - 1048s]
Again, that's something for us to do like me.

👤 あなた [1048s - 1060s]
He has solemnly pledging that what he has said about his sufferings are true. And that he isn't lying about the experiences that going to relate.

👤 あなた [1062s - 1075s]
And then verses 32 to 33, is the first example of cold weakness in this passage. So this is this escape of Damascus, the governor under Aratus.

👤 あなた [1076s - 1131s]
Guarding the city of Damascus and ordered the citizen. But I was lapped down in the past through a window in the wall and the scared kids hands. Now we should note that this escape was arranged by the Damascus church. Will there ever send you got a good idea at Paul, and they wouldn't go through the window. It wasn't Paul panicking and fleeing the business of the with with wisdom you realize, well, here's a guy who's just he's been converted that not that long ago. He's going to be a great force for good, God willing. Let's not test God. Let's let's get a lot of fear of it. So I suppose that's that that's what was going on.

👤 あなた [1134s - 1144s]
Acts chapter nine shows a bit of light on the sense of going. So 're on the works nine, very famous chapter when we read of his conversion.

👤 あなた [1153s - 1161s]
Adverse 23 to 25 of Acts nine, When many days had passed, the Jews clothed to kill him. But their cock became known as Saul. They were watching the gates day and night.

👤 あなた [1162s - 1171s]
In order to kill him. But his disciples took him by night, and not him by a opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket,

👤 あなた [1175s - 1176s]
So the Jews were angry.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1178s - 1179s]
They were seeking to kill him.

👤 あなた [1180s - 1201s]
Likely, this was a little while after his conversion. And having immediately begun to preach persuasively in Damascus, He had also bantered in the king Arabic since Navati and kingdom part of the Arabian Peninsula.

👤 あなた [1202s - 1220s]
Call tells us in relation one seventeen. That's he went to Aurelia after his conversion. Now I think the way that is often popularly understood is that this was, like, Paul's time at seminary.

👤 あなた [1220s - 1241s]
With Jesus himself as the instructor, and he was just there alone with God and learned everything during that time that he healed on his ladders on of great experiences of God and and so forth.

👤 あなた [1242s - 1252s]
And then sometimes there's the exhortation, but The pastors of and old writers get into your Arabia and so on and so forth. You know?

👤 あなた [1252s - 1264s]
In other words, can end your study, three or four hours in the morning and spend time on with God. We need to do that, but but I don't think that's what what the text about God going to earlier there.

👤 あなた [1264s - 1267s]
Is is teaching.

👤 あなた [1271s - 1287s]
He he was not an active while he was there. He was preaching. And then both Damascus and the kingdom of of Arrates, he was seeing success in preaching and opposition from opponents.

👤 あなた [1289s - 1302s]
Soaratus and the Jews who probably wouldn't have had much time for each other Otherwise, they come together and they both won't read of coal.

👤 あなた [1305s - 1325s]
So this early pursuance, of preaching could have fostered pride in a pulp. He was a man clearly. He was proud as a fallacy. And he's converted now. He couldn't that temptation still. But the incident here destroys that.

👤 あなた [1327s - 1339s]
Paul relates this in a glorious escape with a sense of shame, not because he was deserting the They had planned to preserve his life.

👤 あなた [1339s - 1368s]
But he must have reflected how he was struggling toward Damascus as the hunter and had to sneak away probably in a smelly fish basket or something like that as the hunted looking back core hosts in this, it shows how gold preserved as weak vessel. Apostle what he was. He wasn't a super apostle.

👤 あなた [1369s - 1372s]
But his ministry was authentic,

👤 あなた [1375s - 1433s]
There's a a fascinating potential illusion in the verses. And and, I mean, this is just brilliant for preaching, I think, but we really can't be a 100% sure of it. So we hope that we careful. But a brilliant brilliant potential illusion In the first century, a soldier could be awarded what was called the corona the crown of the wall, something like that, the trap in translation for being the first to scale a wall in a siege And, of course, when when a baffler's gland on, it's chaos. So anybody could say it, and no one could necessarily verify it. So you have to swear a solemn oath to the gods.

👤 あなた [1434s - 1444s]
That it was really you In verse 32, to 33, Paul put some cell phones and he says,

👤 あなた [1448s - 1485s]
I was the first one retreating down the wall So his corona morals or crowness of all highlighted not strength but weakness Now Murray Harris isn't so convinced that the Corinthians would have recognized the corona muralis in this reference. But it's interesting nonetheless. And as Moo says, it's hardly apheroic means of escaping. So then so what does Paul's post?

👤 あなた [1486s - 1514s]
It is in his weakness. That's the context of is weakness Then the reason for calls boosting, so we're chapter 12 from the five, how does Paul go toe to toe here with the supraproof prophets and why do you think you might be using the the third person in in doing so?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1550s - 1556s]
Is it, like, so that he's hesitant to boast? Of himself.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [1557s - 1561s]
So he's using the third person just to be a bit more humble with it.

👤 あなた [1568s - 1580s]
Yeah. I mean, I I certainly think that's that that that's part of it. Yeah. Although he does make it I think it's clear enough that it's himself.

👤 あなた [1580s - 1582s]
But that that he is referring to.

👤 あなた [1591s - 1595s]
Okay. How does he take them all then? How does he? Do two to two here?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1614s - 1636s]
Could it be there was a boasting in experiences in the spirit experiences or experiences in the Christian life and and and so Paul also opens up in some of the experience that he has had that actually qualifies him to be even a super extra person in a way.

👤 あなた [1643s - 1650s]
A super extra, full full full. Extra super full full. In other words, an authentic one. Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1652s - 1662s]
He seems to kind of match these superposals on their own kinda terms, definitions of authority. Seems very reluctant to do so.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1665s - 1687s]
And and but but the like, hey. If we're really gonna go this way, I've got the trunk card. But nonetheless, that's not true where true strength comes from. It's from then then he goes on from there. But, it seems to have a look looked at I, you know, I trump you, but that's not really the true the true sign of authentic apostleship, perhaps.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1691s - 1695s]
Which maybe is partly why he is a third person because it expresses a reluctant

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1697s - 1697s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1701s - 1720s]
And, yeah, it also fits what he's describing. You know, the the whether this this happened. I've I've had experiences but I'm not here to talk about that, really.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1721s - 1721s]
Well, yeah.

👤 あなた [1723s - 1733s]
There are sometimes, I suppose, when you're almost of doing some cement and solves like here. You know, you're outside of yourself and Right.

👤 あなた [1733s - 1757s]
In in in doing so. I mean, just don't really basic things like I'm trying think both from the the airport after long trip at night at your airlines. Well, I probably shouldn't be doing this, and you're just holding you're really trying to holding the wheel of the car, but it's not kind of necessarily a very sensible thing to be to be doing.

👤 あなた [1759s - 1790s]
On a more positive level, there are times perhaps, but then So I've read that Mhmm. That you your sort of thought was become unconscious of yourself, and they're just you know, you're just delivering a a message with an element of an unusual sense of spiritual power, and that that can be quite a quite a pretty experience, actually.

👤 あなた [1792s - 1799s]
But yeah. So Paul is referring to himself and the third person.

👤 あなた [1804s - 1807s]
He relates this experience from about fourteen years previously.

👤 あなた [1811s - 1823s]
Which would have been therefore, shortly after the basket experience of the just read about and shortly after not that long after, its conversion really.

👤 あなた [1824s - 1827s]
Now maybe the Jouselis third person was simply a convention.

👤 あなた [1830s - 1851s]
Or perhaps a desire to reflect his boosting in what seems like an experience more befitting a super apostle So Paul could also greater spiritual experiences that were genuine and authentic.

👤 あなた [1857s - 1874s]
Than if the superopposals know Verse seven speaks of revelations. In the plural of of the back of verse seven, but he speaks there of some And plural of course, which is a one this kind of really superb supernatural, if you like, spiritual.

👤 あなた [1880s - 1907s]
Experience. So we cannot or is on to articulate what he saw. He's forbidding the tale when he cared. He's reluctant even the mentionness and yet the super apostles were talking about such things, and they were totally unfeel imitations.

👤 あなた [1908s - 1924s]
So they got forced him to it. That's why I need tells of these great revolutions, and it his weaknesses that Paul wishes to boost him.

👤 あなた [1928s - 1944s]
So that's a priority. Interim calls post paid, what do you think is even more important for than genuine extraordinaries for the two experience us, what's more important than that, what's all do you think?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1959s - 1962s]
Encountering the Lord by receiving his grace.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1967s - 1968s]
Grace is sufficient.

👤 あなた [1974s - 1989s]
Yeah. I mean, not certainly there. The versions that follow. We have a that Adaptily is in an encounter with with Christ himself, not just some some experience.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1994s - 1995s]
Experience is something that's that happens in a sense of cannot be be questioned, but what did that experience lead lead the person to?

👤 あなた [2006s - 2023s]
That is a fundamental question. And then on verse five to six, there's something else he says. That means a priority more so than the experience itself.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2024s - 2026s]
Yeah. They not not becoming seated.

👤 あなた [2028s - 2086s]
Not becoming conceited. I refrain from it. So that no one might think more of me than than he sees in me or hears from me. So this character as well, isn't it? Paul says he will only boost of his weaknesses. And while he could boost with this, and all the real experiences he's concerned that no one might think more of me than he sees in me, or hears from me So Paul is the last one to dismiss genuine Christian experience even of a fairly extraordinary nature and a you read that and they wouldn't consider this extraordinary at all if you read Ephesians three fourteen to 21, what he prays for them.

👤 あなた [2086s - 2116s]
And we really begin thinking about that. You know? We're realigned. You know? We just look so little really of genuine spiritual experience But the priorities for cross shaped character must be produced by such experience and is the safer ground for assurance of the enjoined faith.

👤 あなた [2117s - 2135s]
So Dawn Carson writes no matter how spectacular, the private field, no matter how telehealthy you can ignition, it cannot displace conduct and speech as more reliable and the case of how closely anyone follows.

👤 あなた [2136s - 2154s]
Christ So a good parallel here is Galatians six fourteen. But far be it from me to most acceptance across of our Lord Jesus Christ by which the world has been crucifying to me and I to the world.

👤 あなた [2157s - 2159s]
So that's the priority.

👤 あなた [2164s - 2168s]
Then the the object that goes to sting.

👤 あなた [2172s - 2188s]
Overseas Christ on his his grace, but the thorn and the flesh centers in at first. Seven. I'm following. To keep me from being too ill, I'd find a subpassing the weakness of their revelations.

👤 あなた [2189s - 2190s]
A thorn has given me in the flesh, a liver.

👤 あなた [2199s - 2205s]
The what is the benefit the the thorn and the flesh then.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2242s - 2252s]
It it keeps poor humble in a sense that prevents him from having pride, or building too much pride in himself. Keeps him grounded essentially.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2255s - 2259s]
Yep. Yep. That's it.

👤 あなた [2260s - 2270s]
That's I'm checking that's that that's what it says. To keep me from being too late at night speculation on what the thought is.

👤 あなた [2273s - 2286s]
Goes on without any of what being settled, Moe says. But Paul's focus is on on the purpose which we've just been, like, talking about. It keeps them from into a labels.

👤 あなた [2287s - 2293s]
Keeps them being too puffed up. Let's get you a Swalker is a god first audio teacher.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2293s - 2296s]
Accomplishment. I hope you find our teaching in your journey with

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2296s - 2297s]
Jesus.

👤 あなた [2297s - 2305s]
And then in verses nine and ten. We see a further illustration of what Paul had said in chapter one verse nine.

👤 あなた [2310s - 2321s]
We read that at the beginning, but three so three times I feel that the Lord about this that it should be evenly. But he said to me, my grace is for you for my palmer.

👤 あなた [2322s - 2347s]
Is made perfect in weekends Therefore, I will go stone more gladly if my weaknesses so that the porn of crush now rest upon me, the sake of Christ, then I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions and commodities, when I am weak then I'm I'm strong

👤 あなた [2352s - 2385s]
One nine. Thorns and the flesh are designed to make us rely. Not all of ourselves, but on God who lives us. The dad, So in this passage with Thor, for which he had pleaded, three time to remove helped Paul to see that God's grace is sufficient But when I am weak, then I am strong.

👤 あなた [2392s - 2400s]
So Christ administering God's grace to Paul by his spirit is the object of Paul's.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [2400s - 2403s]
Not important. Just to catch up. It is Catchling.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2403s - 2407s]
Trinitarian number. Cruciform is boosting.

👤 あなた [2412s - 2432s]
So I'll just finish up, and then we can have questions and discussion over the number if you wish. So this is a key passage in understanding the ups and downs of life for all who are in Christ and the gods.

👤 あなた [2435s - 2450s]
Three three perspectives, three cortical hyperfinish. So Lou, our is perhaps the text is deliberately vague as to what the thought is so that anybody for whatever difficulty they're facing can find comfort in old experience

👤 あなた [2453s - 2455s]
So if he said, well, the third one was

👤 あなた [2461s - 2486s]
No evidence. No one of those things has ever suggested that. But so say that's what he had said. Well, then not not the limits that doesn't there? People who wouldn't have they should, but they wouldn't necessarily seem the application of them. But it's kept It keeps us wondering, and therefore, whatever it is, we can identify with both.

👤 あなた [2489s - 2508s]
Gorman, considering the exalted experience and the thorn rights, would be the norm for Paul's life. The divine answer is the gift of weakness and tribulation. That is the norm for and the essence of apostolic existence.

👤 あなた [2509s - 2532s]
The criterion of authenticity that both transcends and authenticates all other experiences of God's presence and harm. Home fragments contain numerous pithy sayings that could serve us as my model, but few express himself his mission better than this. Whenever I am weak, then I am strong.

👤 あなた [2538s - 2548s]
And our very harvest challenges are simple, did not simply muster up his courage and struggle on

👤 あなた [2553s - 2558s]
Make a make a stoic paracise behind dinner toss, honey, violent stone,

👤 あなた [2561s - 2578s]
We should see an illusion, not the portrainability to cope with adversity by harnessing all his personal resources but to his experience of Christ's power sometimes in delivering him from adversity.

👤 あなた [2578s - 2588s]
Sometimes in grounding him strength, to endure hardship, but always in equipping him for effective service.

👤 あなた [2594s - 2598s]
Okay. Thank you. Any questions? Or comments on the final moments, please?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2644s - 2645s]
Okay. Good.

👤 あなた [2647s - 2653s]
Well, we we have a few minutes if you want to have an ask me anything then, or can wrap it up. I don't don't mind, really.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2656s - 2659s]
Gary, can I ask you a Yeah?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2659s - 2659s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2660s - 2671s]
Controversial question I'd like to ask you. If we discovered hypothetically, one of Paul's type of other mattress to the group kids.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2672s - 2680s]
That have been lost to time. What what kind of the thought authority do you think it was holy by the Christian? Would it would it be on the level of scripture?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2681s - 2682s]
What kind of authority we owe?

👤 あなた [2690s - 2700s]
Well, I think maybe it's a bit simplistic and naive to say that and do you think that, you know, go to Providence comes into this.

👤 あなた [2703s - 2718s]
And I will answer the question, but but but, you know, he has preserved scripture for us in terms of what he intends us to have.

👤 あなた [2721s - 2723s]
It may be I don't know.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2723s - 2725s]
Be expert on this.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2729s - 2737s]
So everything at all, I'm not very much about it. Not every cent. Some other of these letters were known to some and available.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2738s - 2755s]
They were not, however, recognized by the church would be historically fascinating. I'm sure they might be edifying and helpful to read much more than than I'd imagine any contemporary Christopher would be.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2756s - 2783s]
But they are not, nevertheless, good peer. And they're not scripture for a reason. So Paul in and of himself, not what what was not infallible, you know, and may have written things in some of his addresses that that we could question argue with, but those aren't the ones that that they have until the

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2792s - 2795s]
A couple of quotes are a little bit too, some apocryphal stuff, and it's a and and that's a good question now.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2800s - 2809s]
There's that quote from is it first or whatever it is? Not written by ENOC, of course. That's that's intertestamental.

👤 あなた [2809s - 2814s]
But, you know, he's bringing that in as an expression of of the truth and the in a sense, it becomes and scripture headed them, and he he advanced has been done under under divine inspiration like wise if I don't necessarily do for this, if Philippines 02/2011 was a 06/02/2011 was a preexisting him.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2842s - 2853s]
That, you know, that has become my part of part of scripture and expresses the truth in a way that a few other passages do. About Christ.

👤 あなた [2856s - 2859s]
So so, yeah, I think that's coming out of Trump.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2859s - 2874s]
Trinity angles that if there was x canonical stuff that fragments were taken from to be in scripture go over them when we're seeing it out, and likewise, present anything else he intended us to have.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2879s - 2886s]
I mean, I probably would have satisfied that. Scholars, but, you know, I think it's a good really thumb to work with.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [2886s - 2887s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2887s - 2896s]
It's just I put a a fascinating just like you've historically because I absolutely agree with you. Preservation, sufficiency, what's been having done stuff.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2896s - 2904s]
Of course. But you wonder when Paul was writing what we now call first term things as opposed to when he was sitting at his desk or dictating.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2904s - 2916s]
What we've lost. Whether he self consciously thought there was difference. You know, it's just it's just fascinating to start thinking about whole self understanding of what he was doing when he wrote because he held authority.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2917s - 2930s]
In both instances. But to hand down his authority in one instance to ask Just it's just so fascinating with that God's sovereignty is interacting with Paul's historical and a high perception.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2930s - 2949s]
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question, which I know if there's a definitive answer to you. Did they know Well well, this you know, this is scripture. I'm writing for like, a personal letter, you know, to fully money. You know?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2949s - 2956s]
Dealing with a pastoral issue. You know? You know what I mean? So so that's fascinating to Saint Gongland.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2961s - 2996s]
Do you do you think the same is true then if we know that Jesus spoke loads of words that were written down in the gospels. That if you know, if we think it was verifiable that we found a document, things that she just said, obviously, there are various claims to ex things that Jesus said that we could say, yeah, maybe Jesus said it. But even if we could send down guarantee that you said that it it still is not part of our inspired scripture because this is to the closed cap, and this is what we've got. Would you would it be the same

👤 あなた [3005s - 3024s]
My my doctor has script. Here would say yes. But, of course, it's an entirely hypothetical. Question. Mean, if it could be proven that Jesus said that, obviously, we should what we should take it very seriously, whatever the contents of it are.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3028s - 3031s]
You know, that that says on Acts 20, those are at least as our Lord has said, it was more less typically than the season.

👤 あなた [3031s - 3035s]
I don't think we see precisely those who are in the gospel.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3036s - 3040s]
So there may be other examples.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [3044s - 3045s]
Excuse me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3057s - 3072s]
And, like, I was even in long term thinking it was the the the words of the Lord of God those supper and the turmoil. The first actual and script you read it saying. That that's like the first in script you read it saying.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3072s - 3082s]
Of Jesus. We have, I think, assuming that that that was written before that. The gospels were written, which I think is quite like most probably is the case.

👤 あなた [3093s - 3095s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3097s - 3098s]
Well, shall we leave it there then?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3103s - 3105s]
Olivia, would you like to pray, please, for us?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [3107s - 3142s]
Yeah. Of course. Father God, I thank you that you are a great God. I that you are supreme over all. And, father, that you have given us these letters from Paul that we can read them and be blessed by them and hear your will through them. And I just pray as we them and continue to study them, we will keep our eyes fixed on you, Lord, that we would stay near to the cross that we would remain humble and that we would proclaim your word faithfully. Thanks again.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [3142s - 3145s]

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [3285s - 3287s]
Hobbit? Hobbit? Hobbit? Hobbit?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3288s - 3302s]
Man. This is going well. I'm getting a Sky Watcher. I'm getting a Sky Watcher one thirty Dobsonian Telescope. Yes. I've done a lot of research on this over the last few months.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3303s - 3318s]
To balance 30 with value. Trying to make sure what I'm getting is not a toy, basically, and it's worth it. And what telescope will let me do is it'll allow me to see things I've never seen before with my own eyes. I'll be able to see Jupiter and its moose.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3319s - 3328s]
I'll be able to see a Saturn, be able to see Neptune, all the planets. Be able to see the moon, the creator of the moon, creators of the moon. What are you laughing at the back there, Jonathan?

👤 あなた [3328s - 3330s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3332s - 3343s]
Well well, you say that, but you know what? Wales, we're incredibly blessed in Wales. Don't know if you know this. Are the top 10 places in the world to to view the night sky, the top 10 list, two of them are in

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [3343s - 3344s]
Wales.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3344s - 3345s]
Of them are in Wales.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [3345s - 3346s]
What?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3346s - 3357s]
First one is the Cow Peninsula. And the second one is the Breckenbeacons. Of all the places in the world, supposedly, we have two of the best. So we're designated the dark sky country, Wales.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3358s - 3367s]
So I'm gonna be once I figure out to use the task code, if anyone wants to come to the Breakthrough Beacons and I've called out my with me, Hello. Ladies, make sure we you we're coming to group or something.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3370s - 3374s]
If the conditions are right, I'm pretty sure what I'll be able to see will take my breath away.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3376s - 3388s]
And so that's why I'm excited. It's not because I like gadgets, but because I know it will deepen my sense of all. Of God's creation, It will help me see clearly what is always been there.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3390s - 3397s]
And I have no doubt it will lead me to a deep worship of God. I'm blown away by people like Brian Cox. I love Brian Cox as TV shows.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3398s - 3407s]
I'm blown away and he gets he gets completely in awe of creation. He completely misses the creator. And it's meant to lead us that the creation takes us so far.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3408s - 3422s]
It takes us far enough to believe that there must be a God. That you need gospel who this god is. But here's what's been striking to me as I thought about that as for today. All these things, the pints, the scars, bath, the space.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3427s - 3434s]
Real because I bought a pedestrian, but they're almost there. It don't suddenly appear because I'm excited to go to new toy.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3437s - 3449s]
The difference isn't their presence. They've always been there, but what's changed in my affinity to see them? In some small way, I guess, hold be nearer.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3451s - 3460s]
Here in a sense that when I look for a telescope, I can without a telescope, I can look up, and I can still see the planets fact, can.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3460s - 3467s]
Quite often, if the moon is bright, you can see a planet often nearby that looks like a bright start. I can do that without the tethoscope.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3468s - 3477s]
I can, without the telescope, affirm that the sky is incredible, that space is awesome, that I can affirm it's vast. I can see it's beautiful.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3479s - 3489s]
But believing those things is not the same as seeing them. Through a telescope. I guess that's a bit of an analogy of what I want to speak about.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3490s - 3500s]
Today. I know so I've known that I've wanted to speak on what I would like speak of today since October. Been kinda sitting there for a while.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3501s - 3525s]
I've talked to a few people about it. And today is less of a sermon and it's more of an exaltation. Now that's a bit of a funny word, isn't it? You know, sermons being where look at a bible passage, we try to explain it externally, and we allow the holy spirit to speak to us about how what we've trained. Our lives. The Bible's alive, and you trained

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3528s - 3530s]
Well, an exhortation This is what I do.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [3531s - 3533s]
You've regularly owned this part of the road, is it?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3533s - 3548s]
It's it's more of an impassioned pleat. It's a passionate call to action. It's an encouragement to the children.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [3549s - 3550s]
To respond to God in some sort of way.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3552s - 3569s]
And that's what I'm gonna try and do today. I'm gonna try and issue an impassioned plea to each of you here. And me as well. I'm praying and hoping and trusted that the Holy Spirit will help me because not much of a showman.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3569s - 3577s]
There's some people that are really good at and and and in some ways that feels like that helps. But, no, this is we we don't want anything fake. I don't want anything fake.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3578s - 3588s]
I don't want to try and emotionally manipulate you into to active action. I trust that the Holy Spirit will move us spiritually and move our hearts to the affections.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3589s - 3596s]
I truly believe that there are people in this room that need to hear what we're about to say today.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3600s - 3615s]
Hear this message is for you. It's for all of us, really, in a sense. But just as I've been praying about it, I think specifically, anyone in mind, have no one in mind. I think there's people in here that this is for you today.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3617s - 3627s]
In fact, you're meant to hear this. Message. I get sent from God that you need to hear this. So back to the telescope for a moment.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3629s - 3631s]
Believe in the sky is stunning.

That's quite traumatic.

It was for him to be vulnerable like that with us. Isn't it? It was I wanna explain it. But but in many ways, they're very different to us. They're massive 400 big church in it.

Yeah.

👤 あなた [221s - 235s]
A good Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course, when when Mitch and I went up. Yeah. But the town's half the size of Barry, so it's it's inspirational in that sense because a 400 person church in a city is great, not that hard.

👤 あなた [235s - 244s]
Percentages wise. No. No. Then in a town where they were, like, 70, 80 adults, now they're four hundreds. And lots of them have come through alpha and other things. That's that's pretty exciting.

👤 あなた [244s - 255s]

Yeah. I can't please stay again. Good. I'll see. See you soon.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [406s - 418s]
Very curious about this mystery. Newstool. Calcior shrugged. I don't see why. You always work with mistings. Yes. But this is nice.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [419s - 432s]
Dachshund nodded. We can't start until this evening, though. How'd you get in anyway? I had men watching the dress. How you doing?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [442s - 444s]
That's my getting last night. But how?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [450s - 458s]
To take some getting used to. I'll see your swab. I don't see why. You always work with mistakes. Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [469s - 490s]
Said it would take some getting used to. Fine. Who's coming tonight? Well, Breeze and Ham will be there, of course. They're very curious about this mystery job of yours. Not to mention that they're annoyed that I won't tell them what you've been up to this last few years. Good, Kelsey said with a smile. Let them wonder.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [491s - 503s]
How about trap? Dachshund shook his head. Trap dead. The ministry finally caught up with him a couple months ago. Didn't even bother sending him to the pits. They beheaded him on the spot.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [505s - 520s]
Gelsier closed his eyes, exhaling softly. It seemed that the steel ministry caught up with everyone, eventually. Sometimes, Kelsey felt that a scar mistings wasn't so much about surviving as it was about picking the right time to die.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [521s - 532s]
This leaves us without a smoker, Kelsey finally said, opening his eyes. You have any suggestions? Ruddy, Dachshund said. Gelsier shook his head.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [533s - 547s]
No. He's a good smoker, but he's not a good enough man. Dachshund smiled. Not good enough man to be on a thieving crew. Hell, I have missed working with you. Alright.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [547s - 548s]
Who the?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [548s - 569s]
Go Galcia thought for a moment. Is clubs still running that shop of his? As far as I know, Dachshund said slowly. He's supposed to be one of the best smokers in the city. I suppose Dachshund said. But isn't this supposed to be kind of hard to work with?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [570s - 582s]
He's not so bad, Kelsey said. I once you get used to him. Besides, I think he might be a man to this particular job. Alright. Dachshund said, shrugging.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [582s - 594s]
I'll invite him. I think one of his relatives is a tiny. Do you want me to invite him too? Sounds good, Kelsey here said. Alright, Dachshund said.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [595s - 606s]
Well, beyond that, there's just Eaton, assuming he's still interested. He'll be there, Kelsey said. It better be, Dachshund said.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [606s - 658s]
It'll be the one paying us after all. Kelsey or nodded then frowned. You didn't mention Mark. Dachshund shrugged. I warned you. Your brother never did approve of our methods. And now, where do you know, He won't even have anything to do with Heedon and the rebellion anymore. But alone with a bunch of criminals like us. I think we'll have to find someone else to infiltrate the obligators. No, Calcio said. He'll do it. I'll just have to stop by to persuade him. If you say so, Dachshund fell silent then, and the two stood for a moment, leaning against the writhing and looking out over the ash stained city. Dachshund finally shook his head. This is insane, Kelp smiled. Feels good, doesn't it?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [659s - 671s]
Dachshund nodded. Fantastic. It will be a job like no other, Kelsey said, looking north. Across the city, and toward the twisted building at its center.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [672s - 695s]
Thawkshawn stepped away from the wall. We have a few hours before the meeting. There is something I want to show you. Think there's still time if we hurry. Kelsey returned with curious eyes. Well, I was going to go and chastise my prude of a brother, but will be worth your time, Daxon promised.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [698s - 741s]
Ben sat in the corner of the safe house's main lair. She kept to the shadows as usual. The more she stay out of sight, the more the others would ignore her. She couldn't afford to expend lock keeping the men's hands off of her. She'd barely had time to regenerate what she'd used a few days before during the meeting with the obligator. The usual ravel lounged at the tables in the room, playing at dice or discussing minor jobs. Smoke from a dozen different pipes pooled at the top of the chamber, and the walls were stained dark from countless years of similar treatment. The floor was darkened with patches of ash. Like most thieving crews, Cayman's group wasn't known for its tidiness.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [742s - 749s]
There was a door at the back of the room, and beyond it lay a twisting stone stairway that led up to a false rain grate in an alleyway.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [750s - 788s]
This room, like so many others, hidden in the imperial capital of Lutherdale, wasn't supposed to exist. Rough laughter came from the front of a chamber where it came and sat with a half dozen cronies, enjoying a typical laughter of ale and crass jokes. Cayman's table sat beside the bar where the overpriced drinks were simply another way Cayman exploited those who worked for him. The Lutherdale criminal element had learned quite well from the lessons taught by the nobility. Binn tried her best to remain invisible. Six months before, she wouldn't have believed that her life could actually get worse without Reen.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [789s - 803s]
Yet despite her brother's abuse of anger, he had kept the other members from having their way with Vin. Their were relatively few women on thieving crews, Generally, those women who got involved with the underworld ended up as whores.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [803s - 822s]
Green had always told her that a girl needed to be tough. Tougher even than a man if she wanted to survive. You think some crew leader is gonna want a liability like you on his team, he had said. I don't even wanna have to work with you, and I'm your brother. Her back still throbbed.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [822s - 833s]
Came in and whipped her the day before. The blood would ruin her shirt, and she wouldn't be able to afford another one. Cayman was already retaining her wages to pay the debts Reen had left behind.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [834s - 850s]
But I am strong, she thought. That was the irony. The beatings almost didn't hurt her any Farine's frequent abuses had left Bin resilient, while at the same time teaching her how to look pathetic and broken.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [850s - 862s]
A way, the beatings were self defeating. Bruises and welts mended but each new lashing left bin more hardened, stronger. Caiman stood up.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [863s - 878s]
He reached into his vest pocket and pulled out his golden pocket watch. He nodded to one of his companions, then he scanned the room searching for for her. His eyes locked on bin. It's time.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [879s - 883s]
Ben frowned. Time for what?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [886s - 891s]
The ministries canton of finance was an imposing structure. But then if

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [896s - 897s]
Thank you.

👤 あなた [908s - 910s]
And I don't know what's happened to it. It's like

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [910s - 910s]
my brain.

👤 あなた [912s - 916s]
Thought I'd be able to find it. Can't zoom anything.
