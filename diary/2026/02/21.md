### 💬 Family Morning Routine Before Jude’s Football

**時間**: 18:20

The recording captures a busy family morning as they get Jude ready for football. There’s playful teasing about smells, cold toes, and being a “cheeky chap,” along with some light concern about always watching the time to be somewhere. Jude expresses not liking his hair, and the parent reassures him and suggests finding a hair product to help. They negotiate clothes, socks, brushing teeth, and timing so they can leave on time, while discussing dinner options like spaghetti bolognese or sandwiches before football. There’s mention of a cancelled hospital-related matter and that it won’t be resolved before a trip to France. The conversation ends with putting on boots and a coat in the rain and heading to the car, followed by a brief unrelated audio clip about embargoes and charging fees, likely from external media.

**📋 アクションアイテム**:
- [ ] Research hair products to help Jude’s hair
- [ ] Message Hannah about the hospital appointment being cancelled
- [ ] Message Jude’s mum about focusing on Jude with the hospital cancellation
