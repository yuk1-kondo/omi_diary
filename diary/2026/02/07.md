### 💬 Family Trip To Buy Fish And Set Up Tank

**時間**: 20:38

A family spends the day preparing their home aquarium and running errands together. They discuss water testing accuracy, tire pressure issues on the car and get a slow puncture topped up at a garage. The parents coordinate getting themselves and the children (including Elliot and Jude) ready to leave, talk about snacking, ultra-processed foods, and household chores the kids should help with. At the garden centre/aquatic shop, they have the tank water tested, get advice on cycling a 40L aquarium, appropriate starter fish, stocking levels, water testing methods, and feeding. After comparing species (ember tetras, guppies, various rasboras and tetras), they decide on a small shoal of neon green rasboras as hardy starter fish, purchase them along with a liquid water test kit, and receive acclimation and care instructions. Back home, they adjust the heater, float and acclimate the bag over 30–60 minutes, plan light cycles and future additions of guppies, and mention coming back in about two weeks for more fish. Alongside this, they talk about grandparents’ upcoming and past knee surgeries, budgeting for takeaway food, Xbox Live service outages and gaming, and planning for Elliot to go bowling with friends on a future Wednesday when a relative can give him a lift.
