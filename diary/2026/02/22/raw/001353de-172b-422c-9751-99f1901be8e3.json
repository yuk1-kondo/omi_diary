    "title": "Rich and Kevin Discuss Tim’s Situation",
    "overview": "Rich takes a call from Kevin and another participant to discuss a complex pastoral situation involving a man named Tim and his estranged wife, Jo (or Joe). After some brief small talk about the poor weather and Rich’s upcoming trip with Rachel to Cape Town for a global network conference, the conversation turns to Tim’s background. Rich explains that Tim used to be a trustee at their church, appears outwardly charming, but has a history of domestic violence, police call-outs, and behavior serious enough that they reported him to social services. Jo initiated a separation with the hope of eventual restoration, but Tim refused to engage with church leadership, instead blaming the church for the breakdown of the marriage and accusing them of causing the separation or ‘divorce’ (though they are not legally divorced). Rich emphasizes that the church never advised divorce and remains committed to restoration where possible. He warns Kevin to be very cautious with Tim, describing him as likely narcissistic, privately aggressive and abusive despite his public charm, and notes that Tim has avoided any reconciliation conversations while still refusing to proceed with a formal divorce for what seems to be financial reasons.",
