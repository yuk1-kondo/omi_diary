    "title": "Johnny and Team Prepare Sunday Church Service",
    "overview": "This recording follows Johnny and various church members as they set up and run a Sunday service. Early on, Johnny coordinates with John, Hannah, Steve, Sam, and others to set up AV, microphones, music stands, and projector, and to decide who will handle the catechism slot. They discuss song arrangements, intros, and how to structure worship with three songs, looping sections to create space. Johnny repeatedly asks for help finding cables and stands, and mentions needing more people on the AV team. There is pastoral conversation about Tim’s remarkable recovery and home visits, Michelle’s ongoing health issues and slow medical process, and prayer for healing and for efficiency of the medical team. Johnny and John confirm Michelle’s previous catechism work and that today’s catechism is covered.\n\nAs people arrive, Johnny greets William, Hannah, Paula, Dave, Grace, and several families, reminding children to sit with parents during worship to keep noise down. Visitors from other Newfrontiers / Regions Beyond / Advance-linked churches talk with Johnny about apostolic oversight, different spheres (Advance, Regions Beyond), and shared connections with leaders like Stephen and Howard. A visiting couple asks how to register as visitors, and Johnny gives them a connection card and mentions the church website and a new sermon podcast-style player Jonathan is managing.\n\nNear the end, Johnny announces that coffees are closing and invites everyone to take their seats for an 11:00 start. He outlines the service order: a family song with actions, worship, communion, and the restart of the catechism section, with children going downstairs around 11:45. He reads from the Psalms about worshiping the Lord, shares an update on Tim’s condition, and leads corporate prayer for Tim, Michelle, and others who are ill. The recording closes as the family song begins with actions on the screen.",
