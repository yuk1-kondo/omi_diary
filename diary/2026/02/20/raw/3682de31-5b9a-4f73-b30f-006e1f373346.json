    "title": "Why Jesus’ Identity Matters For Salvation",
    "overview": "The speaker reflects on the theological importance of Jesus’ identity for Christian salvation. Rather than focusing only on what Jesus did—dying on the cross, rising again, forgiving and saving—the talk emphasizes that who Jesus is (truly human and truly God) is central. The speaker poses probing questions: who are believers actually addressing when they pray to Jesus, and would the cross still save if Jesus were different from how Scripture presents him? The core point is that the effectiveness of salvation hinges not merely on the event of the crucifixion, but on the person who was crucified, arguing that Jesus’ identity is foundational to the success of the redemptive work.",
