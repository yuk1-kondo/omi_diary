    "title": "User Checks On Josh Sargent Transfer Situation",
    "overview": "The user asks their voice assistant for an update on Josh Sargent’s situation at Norwich City Football Club, specifically regarding a transfer to Toronto FC. The assistant explains that Norwich City has agreed a £20 million deal to sell Sargent to Toronto FC, and that he is travelling to North America for a medical and to finalise personal terms. It further outlines the personal breakdown between Sargent and the club in January 2026: he texted manager Philippe Clement to say he was unavailable for an FA Cup match due to transfer distractions, was consequently disciplined and sent to train with the U21s, and tensions escalated in a heated meeting with Clement and sporting director Ben Knapper after an upsetting family-related comment. The assistant notes that Sargent remained focused on a move to Toronto FC to be closer to his family, leading to the current agreement.",
