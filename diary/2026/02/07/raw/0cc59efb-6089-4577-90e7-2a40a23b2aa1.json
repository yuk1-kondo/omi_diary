    "title": "Speaker Reflects On Earning Respect",
    "overview": "The speaker describes how, after spending significant time in a demanding environment, they have earned the right to voice strong opinions. They emphasize that their perspective now carries weight because they worked hard to gain respect and status, not having anything handed to them. They recall how difficult it was when they first arrived, needing to wrest opportunities and recognition from established veterans, and conclude that this struggle enables them to say what they want now.",
