    "title": "Discussion on How Apostles Read Scripture",
    "overview": "The speakers discuss whether the apostles are not only uniquely inspired interpreters of Scripture but also models for how Christians today should read and preach from the Bible. One participant suggests that their interpretive method might be reproducible to a degree, provided modern readers are grounded in deep knowledge of the Old Testament, similar to first‑century fishermen who were familiar with the Psalms. They seek confirmation that they have correctly understood this point about imitation versus irreproducible authority in apostolic interpretation.",
