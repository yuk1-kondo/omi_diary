    "title": "Ben and Pastor Plan Church Finance Transparency",
    "overview": "A pastor (replying to Ben) reflects on a Japanese church’s highly detailed financial reporting and responds to Ben’s suggestion about financial transparency. He agrees strongly with the principle of transparency and accountability, and describes how their own church has previously produced annual finance reports with spending breakdowns combined with vision-casting for the coming year. He emphasizes that, as an elder-led church rather than a member-led (Baptist-style) model, leadership should retain responsibility for spending decisions while still informing the congregation so they can pray and understand where money goes, without turning it into an open forum for opinions on allocations. He proposes thinking carefully about the presentation format and consulting mentors about how other Advance churches handle financial transparency. The pastor also confirms a lunch meeting with Ben on Thursday at 12:00, commits to watching finance training videos Ben prepared before then, and offers to bring lunch.",
