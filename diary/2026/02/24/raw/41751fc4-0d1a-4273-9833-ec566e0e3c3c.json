    "title": "Rachel Expresses Safety Concerns About Open Door",
    "overview": "Rachel argues with her partner about the front door being left wide open while bags and possessions are near the entrance. She repeatedly emphasizes that she is not asking to stop the conversation, only to keep the door shut for safety and security, citing worries about potential theft or criminal activity. She feels her concerns were dismissed, that her partner became angry and refused to talk, and that this reaction was unfair. The conflict leaves her upset before an upcoming appraisal and distressed that someone (likely a child) has woken up to the sound of them arguing.",
