    "title": "Streamer Reacts to Sacrificial Relationship Story",
    "overview": "The user appears to be on a livestream or recording, briefly interacting with another person over something needing an autograph, while in the background a dramatic narrated story is playing. The narration describes a professional Valorant player who starts dating a girl at 17, quickly moves in with her, later proposes, and then leaves his career at its peak when she is diagnosed with cancer so he can care for her. He donates blood and covers all living and medical expenses, sacrifices his own channel and career growth, and supports her throughout treatment. Despite his sacrifices, she ultimately decides to leave him to \"discover herself.\" The user casually comments about already owning something and being able to get it for less, suggesting they are only passively listening to or reacting to the clip rather than personally involved in the story.",
