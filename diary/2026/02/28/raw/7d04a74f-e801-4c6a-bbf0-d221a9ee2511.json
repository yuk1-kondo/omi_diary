    "title": "Parent and Jude Discuss Social Media and Safety",
    "overview": "A parent and Jude talk through plans for a long birthday party that overlaps with watching a Cardiff football match, agreeing that Jude will likely miss the game but have more fun at the party. The parent then explains why social media (Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Messenger) is unhealthy and potentially harmful for children, noting that it may soon be banned for under‑16s and that many parents ignore age rules. They distinguish YouTube from social media, and outline strict conditions if Jude is allowed WhatsApp: no group chats and regular checks of his phone and conversations, emphasizing online safety and Jude’s tendency to break rules compared to Elliot, who is described as a rule‑follower. The parent also stresses the importance of sufficient sleep for children and adults, promising that Jude will one day appreciate limits on screens and social media. Later, they chat about the weather, Jude’s performance as a goalkeeper, and how even professional keepers make mistakes. Jude has suffered a knock to the leg; they examine the bruise, talk through how it happened, and consider ice and whether he can still play. Back at home, they manage beads spilled from Jude’s boots at the doorstep, mention a dead fish in the tank, replace batteries in a toy, and troubleshoot getting the Xbox/Chromecast working, using this as a moment to teach Jude patience. Overall, the interaction is a mix of everyday family logistics, reassurance, and firm guidance on safety and digital habits.",
