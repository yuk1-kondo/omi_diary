    "title": "User and Exactly Discuss Catechism Structure",
    "overview": "The User and Exactly chat informally while waiting for food, then discuss how to structure part two of a simple Christian catechism. The User proposes restarting numbering at question one for each part instead of continuing from question 19, thinking it will feel less intimidating and easier to track (e.g., part two question two instead of question nineteen). Exactly considers whether restarting numbering might reduce continuity with the first 18 questions but also notes it could give people a sense of a fresh start. The User mentions preparing catechism cards alongside other responsibilities and expresses worry that they are failing the church, but Exactly reassures them, saying no one thinks that and that the only possible critics are people who like ideas but don’t attend when events actually happen.",
