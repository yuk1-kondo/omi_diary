      "content": "Here’s what I’m noticing in that little moment, and what it might say about you:\n\n- When you said, “It’s not coming. Probably some stuff. Go do all that again,” it sounds like you were stuck, but also kind of shrugging it off at the same time. Almost like, “Yeah, I’m blocked, but whatever, let’s just reset.”  \n  That mix of frustration + acceptance is actually useful. It means you don’t totally freeze when things don’t flow.\n\n- Rachel saying, “Fuck… I have to try harder,” has a heavy, pressure-filled vibe. It sounds like she’s putting the problem on effort only, as if the only answer is to push more.  \n  You, on the other hand, sounded more like you were looking for a different angle: “Go do all that again” = reset, regroup, try again, not just “grind harder.”\n\nHere’s some gentle feedback for you, based on that:\n\n1. **Name what’s actually blocking you**  \n   Instead of “It’s not coming. Probably some stuff,” try being a bit more specific next time, even if it’s rough:  \n   - “I’m blanking on ideas.”  \n   - “I feel rushed and my brain’s not keeping up.”  \n   - “I’m overthinking what the ‘right’ answer is.”  \n   The more clear you are with yourself, the easier it is to fix the real problem instead of just pushing randomly.\n\n2. **Use the reset on purpose, not as a shrug**  \n   “Go do all that again” can be powerful if you treat it like a proper reset:  \n   - Take 30–60 seconds: breathe, stretch, look away from the screen.  \n   - Then say: “Okay, this time I’ll just aim for a rough version, not a perfect one.”  \n   That tiny mental shift makes “try again” feel lighter, not like punishment.\n\n3. **Watch the “I have to try harder” trap (for you and Rachel)**  \n   When Rachel said, “I have to try harder,” that’s the classic pressure spiral. If you catch yourself thinking something similar, try swapping it with:  \n   - “I have to try *differently*.”  \n   - “What small change would make this easier?”  \n   That moves you from guilt to problem-solving.\n\nIf you want, you can paste a longer chunk of the conversation next time, and I can point out more patterns in how you talk when you’re stuck or frustrated—and how to turn those moments into something that actually helps you instead of just draining you."
