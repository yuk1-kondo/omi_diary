A lot of people *feel* grateful but don’t say anything out loud.\n\nOne small upgrade you could try next time, especially with people you care about, is adding one more word of why, like:\n\n- “You beauty, that helped a lot.”\n- “You beauty, I really needed that.”\n- “You beauty, that made my day.”\n\nIt keeps your natural style, but makes it clearer what you’re grateful for, and people usually feel really good hearing that kind of thing."
