🎤 SPEAKER_1 [13s - 18s]
No. There's two people in this room. Okay? So I appreciate I'm sorry that you don't want it to have. I couldn't hear it.

👤 あなた [18s - 20s]
No. It's not I'm sorry you you don't want it to have it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [20s - 22s]
It is factually, objectively No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [23s - 32s]
Anti superb. I'm sorry. I recognize there's two people. I'm happy with it loud. You not happy with it loud. So I said, I'm sorry. Mhmm. I acknowledge that you would like to have it quite The reason I had it

👤 あなた [32s - 34s]
Actually, pointless apology, missus.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [34s - 35s]
Oh, no. You won't listening to me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [35s - 42s]
Yeah. I'm sure. You weren't you weren't listening to you. You didn't even let me finish my sentence. You didn't let me get to the actual that was like because

👤 あなた [42s - 43s]
That was like that was like a no.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [43s - 47s]
That was like a prelittle bit to my full sentence. Yeah. But that disqualified it because

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [48s - 48s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [48s - 48s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [48s - 52s]
But you didn't know what I about say. You literally didn't know what I was about to say.

👤 あなた [53s - 63s]
Oh, I'm saying No. I'm happy to hear what you're we're about to see next. But the thing you said, first of all, makes me not want to hear it because I'm sorry that you want it quieter.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [63s - 65s]
Oh, that's what you heard.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [65s - 70s]
It? Gotta say it again. No. No. I'm finishing a conversation because I don't think that's fair.

👤 あなた [71s - 72s]
I that's That's exactly what you said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [72s - 80s]
Yeah. Because that's like me saying, the black dog and you're going, wow. You're racist. You're talking about a dog being black.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [80s - 84s]
He's not black. And I was like, hold on. Let me finish the rest of the sentence. And you'll hear what I'm saying.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [85s - 90s]
Black dog was covered in ink because he ran through the ink factory.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [90s - 94s]
And you've made an assumption from three words No.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [94s - 96s]
Or what the rest of us is I'm sorry.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [96s - 108s]
You assumed I'm saying, well, you don't like it, but this is that that's not literal. I was going to say I was about to move into explaining why it was loud and apologize for the fact that it was loud.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [108s - 118s]
I had music, the stuff playing, blah blah blah. I'm sorry. Blah blah blah. But you didn't even let me. You just made that assumption from the very beginning after I said a few words.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [118s - 123s]
The hot like, why would I wanted to I would be more receptive to the second half if it was for the

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [124s - 127s]
Well, you're gonna have to make do with the the false apology at the beginning.

👤 あなた [127s - 127s]
You what?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [130s - 131s]
Honey

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [131s - 135s]
Well, you're not getting If I stopped there and then started talking about cars, maybe that would have been a false apology.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [135s - 143s]
If I actually got to finish the sentence that I leaked literally was only the first third of the way through, then you would have heard the extra words coming up my mat.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [143s - 145s]
Babe. Blinding.

👤 あなた [145s - 146s]
We're just reflecting on a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [147s - 148s]
So funny.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [148s - 148s]
Little

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [152s - 161s]
Made a decision about the first bit of the thing that I said, even though I hadn't actually finished my sentence. I repeatedly told you, let me finish my sentence, and you don't hear what I was gonna say.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [161s - 171s]
But you're repeatedly telling me that I'm saying something. Well, I was saying you didn't hear my whole sentence. I was just ludicrous. So I think that's probably as far as we can go with it.

👤 あなた [255s - 256s]
Yep. Thank you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [335s - 346s]
Can I see something that I'm concerned about? Is Yep. How these days cables are charging Yeah. Are c to c or wherever they are.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [373s - 375s]
And also headphones and stuff as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [375s - 376s]
It's like kind of

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [377s - 381s]
I think they give you, like, headphones. It's just if you want your own ones that are more comfy.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [382s - 386s]
But No. You know? Yeah.

👤 あなた [389s - 392s]

👤 あなた [397s - 404s]
No. On the screenshot I sent you, it tells what clean the the plain type, and you can probably search what sort of connections.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [404s - 410s]

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [474s - 477s]
But availability and type can vary.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [24s - 26s]
Rick would be like, you wanna go see anything? No. Good.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [27s - 28s]
That that that that was it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [29s - 29s]
Whatever you do,

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [33s - 35s]
Oh, lines that I say to get him character.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [35s - 45s]
There's two that I use most often, and first one is Caribbean Queen written by Hugh Jackman, age 16. Caribbean Queen. Age 16.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [45s - 48s]
Which is a line from my first episode of season seven.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [48s - 55s]
And that's kinda more conversational, Rick. And then when I need to get a little more angry, a little more heightened, start yelling, I go, touch my shit and die.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [55s - 61s]
That's not threat from me. That's how advanced my shit is. Touch my shit and die. That's not a threat from me. That's how advanced my shit is.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [61s - 64s]
And that usually gets me there. Oh, lines that I

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [66s - 73s]
Is there any, like, a certain ritual that you do before doing your voice acting for the role? For a scene?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [73s - 83s]
There's a few lines that I'll return to before a session and during a session. That, that bring me back to to invoice. So, there's one from season seven.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [83s - 96s]
Caribbean Queen written by Hugh Jackman, aged six sixteen. I'll just do that a dozen times and then go right into the script. And then if I need to do, if I need to if it's a a scene with a little more yelling, I'll use a different one.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [96s - 103s]
So that's more conversational. The other one that I do is my launch point is touch my shit and die. That's not a threat for me. That's how advanced my shit is.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [109s - 114s]
Rick and Morty co creator, Harmon has finally broken his silence on Justin Roiland.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [114s - 122s]
The biggest take away is that Dan Harmon revealed that he and Justin haven't talked since 2019 and their last conversation was done through text that made Dan cry.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [122s - 129s]
Justin said he was unhappy among other things, and then the conversation turned confrontational. That's when they had to falling out, and they have talked since.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [129s - 144s]
It's been widely reported that Justin stopped coming into office around season three. And in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Dan Harmon revealed that partner was because Justin wasn't happy that Dan brought in his own riders from community because it made it feel like Dan was away the show from Justin.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [144s - 154s]
Dan said, quote, if I had felt I was imposing something, I would have never done it. If anything, what I wanted was for Justin and I both to be able to be increasingly lazy and not show up for work.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [154s - 158s]
That was the dream. The new season drops October 15 and will feature two

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [171s - 179s]
Uh-oh. Oh, hey, Morty. You're my little buddy. You know that? It's it's you and me, Morty. Rick Rick and Morty, a hundred years forever.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [182s - 183s]
Oh, jeez,

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [183s - 184s]
Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [185s - 192s]
I mean, you know, you kinda have things handled without it. Just that hair seaweed? Boy, it's really circling the whole rim

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [192s - 194s]
Guess you gotta jump in without touching?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [0s - 6s]
No worries. Let's keep it simple. If you'd like, we can start with a bridge paragraph connecting last week to this one.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [22s - 27s]
Hello. It's lovely to meet you. Hey. Hi. Hey. Oh, hey. Hey. Hi there.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [27s - 28s]
Nice to meet you.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [29s - 30s]
Hey. Hey. Hello.

👤 あなた [40s - 54s]
So I'm just looking at my back garden at the at the lawn in my garden. And I was just reflecting on how it is that the grass grows during the spring and summer.

👤 あなた [54s - 71s]
When the heat of the sun is shining up upon it. But in that but in the winter, it's doesn't grow. It stays where it is. And I wonder if there's some sort of an allergy there.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [72s - 79s]
Absolutely. Just like the grass needs the warmth of the sun to flourish, our hearts need the presence of Christ's love to grow.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [79s - 86s]
In those colder seasons, we might feel dormant. But his warmth draws us back into growth. It's a wonderful reminder to step into his legs.

👤 あなた [99s - 105s]
What do we think about that in terms of theological coherence to sanctification.
