🎤 SPEAKER_1 [13s - 18s]

👤 あなた [18s - 20s]
No. It's not I'm sorry you you don't want it to have it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [20s - 22s]
It is factually, objectively No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [23s - 32s]
Anti superb. I'm sorry. I recognize there's two people. I'm happy with it loud. You not happy with it loud. So I said, I'm sorry. Mhmm. I acknowledge that you would like to have it quite The reason I had it

👤 あなた [32s - 34s]
Actually, pointless apology, missus.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [34s - 35s]
Oh, no. You won't listening to me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [35s - 42s]
Yeah. I'm sure. You weren't you weren't listening to you. You didn't even let me finish my sentence. You didn't let me get to the actual that was like because

👤 あなた [42s - 43s]
That was like that was like a no.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [43s - 47s]
That was like a prelittle bit to my full sentence. Yeah. But that disqualified it because

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [48s - 48s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [48s - 48s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [48s - 52s]
But you didn't know what I about say. You literally didn't know what I was about to say.

👤 あなた [53s - 63s]
Oh, I'm saying No. I'm happy to hear what you're we're about to see next. But the thing you said, first of all, makes me not want to hear it because I'm sorry that you want it quieter.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [63s - 65s]
Oh, that's what you heard.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [65s - 70s]
It? Gotta say it again. No. No. I'm finishing a conversation because I don't think that's fair.

👤 あなた [71s - 72s]
I that's That's exactly what you said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [72s - 80s]
Yeah. Because that's like me saying, the black dog and you're going, wow. You're racist. You're talking about a dog being black.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [80s - 84s]
He's not black. And I was like, hold on. Let me finish the rest of the sentence. And you'll hear what I'm saying.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [85s - 90s]
Black dog was covered in ink because he ran through the ink factory.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [90s - 94s]
And you've made an assumption from three words No.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [94s - 96s]
Or what the rest of us is I'm sorry.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [96s - 108s]
You assumed I'm saying, well, you don't like it, but this is that that's not literal. I was going to say I was about to move into explaining why it was loud and apologize for the fact that it was loud.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [108s - 118s]
I had music, the stuff playing, blah blah blah. I'm sorry. Blah blah blah. But you didn't even let me. You just made that assumption from the very beginning after I said a few words.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [118s - 123s]
The hot like, why would I wanted to I would be more receptive to the second half if it was for the

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [124s - 127s]
Well, you're gonna have to make do with the the false apology at the beginning.

👤 あなた [127s - 127s]
You what?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [130s - 131s]
Honey

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [131s - 135s]
Well, you're not getting If I stopped there and then started talking about cars, maybe that would have been a false apology.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [135s - 143s]
If I actually got to finish the sentence that I leaked literally was only the first third of the way through, then you would have heard the extra words coming up my mat.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [143s - 145s]
Babe. Blinding.

👤 あなた [145s - 146s]
We're just reflecting on a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [147s - 148s]
So funny.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [148s - 148s]
Little

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [152s - 161s]
Made a decision about the first bit of the thing that I said, even though I hadn't actually finished my sentence. I repeatedly told you, let me finish my sentence, and you don't hear what I was gonna say.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [161s - 171s]
But you're repeatedly telling me that I'm saying something. Well, I was saying you didn't hear my whole sentence. I was just ludicrous. So I think that's probably as far as we can go with it.

👤 あなた [255s - 256s]
Yep. Thank you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [335s - 346s]
Can I see something that I'm concerned about? Is Yep. How these days cables are charging Yeah. Are c to c or wherever they are.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [373s - 375s]

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [375s - 376s]
It's like kind of

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [377s - 381s]
I think they give you, like, headphones. It's just if you want your own ones that are more comfy.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [382s - 386s]
But No. You know? Yeah.

👤 あなた [389s - 392s]

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [27s - 28s]
That that that that was it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [29s - 29s]
Whatever you do,

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [33s - 35s]
Oh, lines that I say to get him character.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [35s - 45s]
There's two that I use most often, and first one is Caribbean Queen written by Hugh Jackman, age 16. Caribbean Queen. Age 16.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [45s - 48s]
Which is a line from my first episode of season seven.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [48s - 55s]
And that's kinda more conversational, Rick. And then when I need to get a little more angry, a little more heightened, start yelling, I go, touch my shit and die.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [55s - 61s]
That's not threat from me. That's how advanced my shit is. Touch my shit and die. That's not a threat from me. That's how advanced my shit is.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [61s - 64s]
And that usually gets me there. Oh, lines that I

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [66s - 73s]
Is there any, like, a certain ritual that you do before doing your voice acting for the role? For a scene?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [73s - 83s]
There's a few lines that I'll return to before a session and during a session. That, that bring me back to to invoice. So, there's one from season seven.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [83s - 96s]
Caribbean Queen written by Hugh Jackman, aged six sixteen. I'll just do that a dozen times and then go right into the script. And then if I need to do, if I need to if it's a a scene with a little more yelling, I'll use a different one.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [96s - 103s]
So that's more conversational. The other one that I do is my launch point is touch my shit and die. That's not a threat for me. That's how advanced my shit is.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [109s - 114s]
Rick and Morty co creator, Harmon has finally broken his silence on Justin Roiland.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [114s - 122s]
The biggest take away is that Dan Harmon revealed that he and Justin haven't talked since 2019 and their last conversation was done through text that made Dan cry.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [122s - 129s]
Justin said he was unhappy among other things, and then the conversation turned confrontational. That's when they had to falling out, and they have talked since.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [129s - 144s]
It's been widely reported that Justin stopped coming into office around season three. And in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Dan Harmon revealed that partner was because Justin wasn't happy that Dan brought in his own riders from community because it made it feel like Dan was away the show from Justin.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [144s - 154s]
Dan said, quote, if I had felt I was imposing something, I would have never done it. If anything, what I wanted was for Justin and I both to be able to be increasingly lazy and not show up for work.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [154s - 158s]
That was the dream. The new season drops October 15 and will feature two

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [171s - 179s]
Uh-oh. Oh, hey, Morty. You're my little buddy. You know that? It's it's you and me, Morty. Rick Rick and Morty, a hundred years forever.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [182s - 183s]
Oh, jeez,

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [183s - 184s]
Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [185s - 192s]
I mean, you know, you kinda have things handled without it. Just that hair seaweed? Boy, it's really circling the whole rim

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [192s - 194s]
Guess you gotta jump in without touching?

👤 あなた [54s - 71s]
When the heat of the sun is shining up upon it. But in that but in the winter, it's doesn't grow. It stays where it is. And I wonder if there's some sort of an allergy there.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [72s - 79s]
Absolutely. Just like the grass needs the warmth of the sun to flourish, our hearts need the presence of Christ's love to grow.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [79s - 86s]
In those colder seasons, we might feel dormant. But his warmth draws us back into growth. It's a wonderful reminder to step into his legs.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [246s - 258s]
I was so you're saying that Adam and Eve, it wasn't God made Adam and Eve to be married I just think that's the easiest way of bringing in Yeah. That doctrine in a way that how are they gonna come to us and argue?

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [281s - 288s]
Well, that's what yeah. Do that is the same with how we follow on from anything, and that's the discussion that how that will vary in the churches.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [288s - 292s]
But what we're not saying is God created

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [292s - 293s]
Yeah. Women and women to be together.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [293s - 304s]
So I just think that do you know That is such a good video just to weedle out anyone who even disagrees with that. Yeah. And if Chloe watches it, and she's not happy with it Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [304s - 309s]
She thinks I don't want Elijah watching doing this scheme. Well, great. Then make that decision.

👤 あなた [310s - 311s]
Well, why was she?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [312s - 322s]
Well, because she might be, like, peep like, she's more unhappy with it. And so therefore, I'd rather it was something as simple as that app.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [322s - 329s]
So if the Americans left over this issue, we could say, well, it was just this literally this video that says, God made Adam and Eve.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [329s - 333s]
Man and wife, man and woman. Man and woman.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [333s - 333s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [339s - 348s]

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [349s - 351s]
Yeah. Yeah.

👤 あなた [351s - 357s]

👤 あなた [239s - 250s]
So Great. Well, I appreciate that. Obviously, you're going on holiday, so there's no rush. But the other thought would be maybe one or two other people that we could trust to also do that, host and and then lead it.

👤 あなた [250s - 263s]
And then that's just a one in three month commitment then, for the leader. That might make it even more manageable. And then I'm sure by September, we'll have a we'll have something an idea for the appetite and something a bit more concrete perhaps.

But it's just like, yeah. No. We're working on that. We're this is all part of the journey.

👤 あなた [511s - 521s]
I'd rather not reveal anything we know because I think that's wrong because I think if I came to someone and said, did you know they've cheated on their husband? And you go, oh,

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [522s - 539s]
And it makes it look like you're like, you have it it it it because no faith, Steve will have no faith in you if he comes to you with a concern that you and and and believes that you didn't know any about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [539s - 547s]
Because then he'll feel like he has to come and share all these issues. When actually you have got a good grip on Ben. I mean, maybe there's stuff we have.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [547s - 555s]
We don't know. We can be honest about that. But if it's something you already know, you can give a feel that it's good to get this other side of things.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [555s - 557s]
But if it is what he's talking about Not equally.

I'm not saying to diminish what you're saying. Oh, yeah. We never really do that. Why are coming to that? Just a appreciative of his side view because he's obviously gonna add something, but you want him to know if you know something that he's sharing, you want him to know I have I've got a handle on it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [592s - 600s]
That's something that we're working on. I e, this is not like a oh. Oh. Oh. Well, now we change our mind because you told me this.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [600s - 604s]
Well, it's something that you already know, but it's good to have more of a fuller picture on some something.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [604s - 605s]
Well yeah.

👤 あなた [606s - 609s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1318s - 1328s]
It's nice, babe. You're done. Thanks, babe. Awesome. If you have that done up there. Because otherwise, what happens is it just goes up that, and it's a good boulder, won't it?

👤 あなた [1329s - 1330s]
No. It's because I got

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1338s - 1340s]
Well, haven't got Colin key. Have you got Colin?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1363s - 1366s]
A typical thermometer comes over while seeds here.

👤 あなた [1366s - 1368s]
They've not messed me.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1368s - 1368s]
Just see.

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [1417s - 1429s]
Kinda like a thing. It's like, for me, very mild egg, but with Okay. Like, with a breaded cover. Oh.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1432s - 1437s]
right. That is between the egg and the bread crumb. Holy pantry process.

👤 あなた [1438s - 1451s]
Crap, basically. Oh, it's cold. It's very calm. Freezing Rachel. Being downstairs and Yeah. It's just the war in the bedroom. So with Steve, let me take a lead a little bit on it, babe.

👤 あなた [1451s - 1461s]
But equally, I'm saying that, what do you think he what what do If he listen. If he comes out and says, I it just doesn't feel right to to me.

👤 あなた [1461s - 1469s]
It's just something about it that I'm not sure about, then that's that's nothing. Frankly.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1471s - 1481s]
I think you need to order that to and recognize that in recent fashion, we don't really share anything that you wanted to come out with the final thing.

👤 あなた [1481s - 1487s]
Yeah. But it's only because we got known truly that's carrying weight with us. Yes. Yes. But it I don't we don't want to delegate it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1488s - 1496s]
That's fine. But in their eyes, they are actually doing quite a lot in some ways. It would make sense to talk to you through with them and then choose to ignore or not.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1496s - 1508s]
But what we've done is we we've turned their helmet or whatever it is because the announcement's been made. And so that's gonna make them feel a little bit more

👤 あなた [1510s - 1511s]
What are they gonna what are they doing then?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1511s - 1527s]
It's gonna make them feel a little bit more runny. It's like a bit more woah. Woah. Woah. Rather than six months ago. But maybe that's a court seek, but don't But maybe they need to undergo a correction in the in the perceived level of input they gave.

👤 あなた [1527s - 1547s]
Do, but I think what would be better in that is just, you know, a meeting with Ben Nello It's kind of talking about the ministry ministry, calling, leadership, just, you know, just, you know, that's what, you know, we're we're But what what do doing that, we're inviting input.

👤 あなた [1547s - 1550s]
Yeah. Inverte Inputating no. It's not what it is. Invite Inviting.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1550s - 1560s]
Sorry. Yes. You get input. But if you tell people, they all hear what you've got to say, it makes it feel very undervalued. If you hear and then you come back with them and say, look, I hear what you're saying. I reflect on that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1560s - 1566s]
We chatted it through. I feel like that's something that needs working on, but it's it's not a a problem.

👤 あなた [1566s - 1568s]
But here's here's the thing, Rich.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1568s - 1581s]
I I think it's think what's happened is we know what we often do. No. People then go in the woah woah woah reaction. Because we didn't bring them in because we didn't wanna hear what they have said. And I think God isn't probably at some point. No. It's not that's not that's not the reason we didn't bring them in.

👤 あなた [1581s - 1585s]
It's not because we we didn't wanna hear what they had to say. Where is it? It's because they're not responsible responsible.

👤 あなた [1585s - 1589s]
It's not they've not been delegated that weight of responsibility on Yeah. To weigh up these things.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1589s - 1599s]
No. But as pastoral people in the church, how can you have men and women's lead with pastoral leaders, people in tribes of their ministry.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1599s - 1601s]
If you're not gonna hear them about the men.

👤 あなた [1601s - 1610s]
Oh, we will hear them, but they We'll hear them, they don't get they they they from my point of view, they're involved at the appropriate stage Yeah.

👤 あなた [1610s - 1624s]
Is all we've said to the church is is But. Benin is taking up trusty ship. He's becoming an he's becoming a trusty He's becoming a treasurer. We are exploring ministry it was the the ministry bit was yes, I mentioned planting, it was very vague.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1625s - 1628s]
It was it was very it was very vague. I didn't it was very vague.

👤 あなた [1628s - 1632s]
Vague. Honey. You it was some sort of it was some sort hang on.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1632s - 1635s]
What did you let me get involved as well in the conversation.

👤 あなた [1635s - 1642s]
Thank you. No. You've dominated it. Let me just say, Rich. Let me just say, because I know what your points are. I'm trying to counter them a bit.

👤 あなた [1643s - 1653s]
Yes. I mentioned the planting, what have you, but I did didn't say we're ex when all we say all I said was we're exploring ministry, what ministry looks like for Ben and Ellen.

👤 あなた [1654s - 1665s]
The future, that that for me, there wasn't no specific role. There was no no timetable. There was no But did you mention planting if that wasn't because that's one of the options available.

👤 あなた [1665s - 1675s]
I think that came out of Well, that came out of that came came out of it. We as a from day one have wanted to raise up leaders of all across all levels.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1675s - 1680s]
Yeah. But what you're doing there is you're making quite a public statement that we believe these guys are going on to

👤 あなた [1680s - 1681s]
We do. Do we not?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1682s - 1693s]
What if you're gonna be doing that and you're you've made that whole decision all on your own essentially, or you and me, Yeah. And I think that's quite No.

👤 あなた [1693s - 1695s]
No. We haven't made There's not really a team

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1695s - 1707s]
No. No. Don't give me one. We haven't got a team available. So I'm I'm aware of that. But in lieu of that, I think You should have singled to a getting anyone's not getting anyone else's opinion.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1707s - 1711s]
We're doing that. Not opinion. I don't be an opinion. I don't be an opinion because no one else is

👤 あなた [1711s - 1716s]
We're doing we're doing what you're we're doing what you're suggesting now at the appropriate moment. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1716s - 1721s]
You didn't ask for their views on it. You told them it was happening. They said, well, I've got issues. You said, well, doing it anyway.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1721s - 1722s]
They're having an opportunity.

👤 あなた [1722s - 1733s]
Okay. It's an expert exploration phase. Okay. It's not guaranteed. Ben and Ellen know that. I don't think And so that's fine. You you keep saying the same lines, and I see what you're telling me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1733s - 1734s]
Blime me, that.

👤 あなた [1734s - 1735s]
I Not a cannon.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1735s - 1745s]
It's saying the same line. Right. I see what you're telling me. But I don't see that in in practice and communication. With the church, with Bed and Ella, and the message that you did with Steven.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1745s - 1752s]
The thing you're telling me is not matching up with the stuff that's actually coming your mouth when you're talking to people about it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1752s - 1757s]
So you can't say oh, no. It's we're not even we're not even at that. Well, obviously, we're we're

👤 あなた [1757s - 1765s]
I'm not backtracking on and and if if this serious concerns, for Ben and Ellen, then fine. But otherwise, there's nothing to do with Steve.

👤 あなた [1765s - 1773s]
He can share his opinion, but he's not carrying leadership response responsibility. I haven't said that he just makes sense. Suddenly, you're you're panicking a little bit.

👤 あなた [1773s - 1775s]
Oh. Oh, what if we've rushed this a little bit? Stop.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1777s - 1798s]
That's not the case. Right. I'm saying, I think we did the process wrong. We're still learning in leadership. I think we don't we know that we're never gonna take what Steven and Lois say with us with with the weight that we would in any other kind of, you know, in leadership team leaders that we are alone.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1798s - 1803s]
We we don't cut that on them. They they may think that they do. We don't. We're not going to they haven't got the same minds at us.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1803s - 1811s]
They haven't got This year? Yeah. Thank you. Haven't got the heart for anything like that. So Yeah. I I'm not saying that

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1811s - 1815s]
No. About taking what they're saying and it influencing our decisions.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1815s - 1826s]
But what I am saying is that it seems a bit bizarre to make an announcement and then gather stuff because all that's gonna happen it's probably more likely to fine.

👤 あなた [1826s - 1830s]
I I Rick, Rachel, I I accept that put. I accept yes. You can because we're running it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1830s - 1831s]
Likely, then

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1831s - 1832s]
I don't get the picture. Alright. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1832s - 1842s]
It's more likely, I think, to lead to a few more awkward conversations, people feeling a bit undervalued, public things being made, and then going, oh, crap.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1842s - 1848s]
Okay. Maybe we're a little bit too soon on that. I think all of those things are more like to happen.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1848s - 1851s]
Made to turn go. Yeah? If we what? I've looked for I'm you.

👤 あなた [1851s - 1855s]
Likely to to happen if we make an announcement and then get

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1855s - 1857s]
Right. Okay. Confirmation after that. Fine. Yes. Good.

👤 あなた [1858s - 1877s]
I agree with you. I I do. I agree with you. The process maybe we could could we could tweak it. That's fine. I I do I do feel a bit like the only thing well, guess why I'm pushing back a little bit is because I thought you were on board with everything that I've done so far, and now suddenly you're not.

👤 あなた [1878s - 1887s]
I told you back in we met with Ben and Ellen in November and we said in that meeting, the the first couple of weekends of January, we're gonna get we're gonna pray for you, we're gonna let people know but we've seen leadership in them.

👤 あなた [1887s - 1890s]
We're calling out exploring it. You were there at that meeting.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1890s - 1894s]
And assembly, you make it sound like, what are you doing? No. I agree to this.

👤 あなた [1894s - 1903s]
No. And let me finish. And the second you can come back on that if you're second point is that on the one hand, you're too busy to be involved in these decisions.

👤 あなた [1903s - 1916s]
You haven't got time, don't wanna talk about it, you can't make time, you're too busy. But then one I make decisions, then in hindsight, you come back and then you have all sorts of really helpful things to say but it's too late by that point.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1916s - 1917s]
So that's my two things.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1917s - 1922s]
Yeah. And I appreciate that. I do understand it's a difficult line to to kind of go along. What

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1922s - 1928s]
I would say is that I think it was quite clear, and I was I was trying to be kind and support

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1928s - 1938s]
I think it's quite clear after you sent the message to Steve and Lois that we agreed that maybe you did say a whole lot of stuff that didn't need to be said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1938s - 1939s]
But but for some reason

👤 あなた [1939s - 1943s]
Yeah. We we talked about this every day, I told you that you didn't read the message I put in the group and you omitted that you hadn't.

👤 あなた [1943s - 1944s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1944s - 1949s]
They never asked that. I still asked that. They never babe. No. Because I said at the end of that conversation receiving listen to no.

👤 あなた [1949s - 1950s]
No. The text

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1950s - 1955s]
I put in there, so look, what we'll do then on the Sundays, we'll just mention treasurer, trustee didn't just do that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1955s - 1963s]
You didn't you You got away. You got you got carried away. No. Your mouth fell ahead of you, and then rather than just stop no.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1963s - 1966s]
You did. Rather than just stop, you then talked about

👤 あなた [1967s - 1968s]
Oh, that's Nina's.

I don't know if it's got a heater. It doesn't seem to have a thermometer thing.

👤 あなた [2208s - 2209s]
Think that question is not included.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2211s - 2232s]
So that is 73,000. Now then there's extra things like the water care filters stuff. I mean, it's gonna be expensive, but once you've got it started, then Elliot can then come choose the gravel.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2232s - 2235s]
So that would be five pounds. Right?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2298s - 2304s]
Sorry. Are you literally not reading the sign that's up there for all them? They turned all the lights off and said they're settling in.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2304s - 2306s]
There's also no lights on our bed.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2306s - 2309s]
Normally, they're bright, light, and blue, and you can all the colors of the fish.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2309s - 2311s]
Right. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. That's what the sign is.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2311s - 2312s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2312s - 2313s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2313s - 2316s]
Anyway, so one of those a perfect one.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2316s - 2321s]
And then if you like, the new from your texture that you

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2322s - 2324s]
Oh, yeah. And all the cardinals, whatever.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2325s - 2335s]

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2336s - 2338s]
Nice. I'll have a little bit of a mix there. No. It's those

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2339s - 2339s]
Oh, yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2341s - 2346s]
And then you could have some of the little chimpy things then.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2346s - 2348s]
Yeah. I don't think you can have one of those

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2349s - 2350s]
I'm not sure.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2351s - 2357s]
People ask about it. They didn't look like they're sudden. So maybe you'd have to go to don't so what? Oh, they say

👤 あなた [2357s - 2360s]
The section. I can't see any second fishes. Okay. But it might be that

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2359s - 2360s]
I think sometimes there's

👤 あなた [2361s - 2363s]
Might be that the window might be able to

👤 あなた [2370s - 2372s]
So it's a 40 liter tank, is it?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2375s - 2379s]
What it does is it's got 20 fish points. Yeah. So what you do is you can hear

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2380s - 2381s]
Yeah. Let's see what the points are.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2382s - 2387s]
Yeah. So like, NeoTex was a one for Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2388s - 2394s]
The shrimp. So then you just kind of figure it out that way. So as long as they're happy with each other and you're not coming

👤 あなた [2394s - 2395s]
No. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2396s - 2397s]
Hello. Hiya.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [2402s - 2402s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2403s - 2410s]
The ones here are better better because they're truthful, the real ones, but you like that they get that attached basically. So

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2411s - 2411s]
Oh, I see.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2411s - 2419s]
You know, like, some you know, when you go to places to, the garden center, just have all the plants in there. Yeah. You can't put them straight into the tank because it's not treated dark.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2419s - 2420s]
It's got all sorts of

👤 あなた [2421s - 2422s]
I see. Are these treated? Or do you mean?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2422s - 2423s]
These are fake.

👤 あなた [2423s - 2425s]
So real ones are in there.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2425s - 2426s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2426s - 2427s]
Where'd you buy them from?

👤 あなた [2427s - 2428s]
You just get them out of the tank? Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2430s - 2432s]
Oh, yeah. Can buy the.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2433s - 2433s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2433s - 2440s]
But then you need to get soil, and you need to do it all that which I was like, oh, that's it. You can put it from it. Yeah. That's a bit more like

👤 あなた [2441s - 2444s]
Yeah. No. It's something to swim through. It'd be nice.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2452s - 2454s]
Suckerfish poop like crazy.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2454s - 2460s]
They're peeing the alvey. They'll clean the algae and wood, but then they'll poop all over everything.

👤 あなた [2461s - 2464s]
Right. Yeah. So what about the what about the other shrimpy ones?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2464s - 2469s]
Well, they clean up the, like, leftover. They eat up, like, the leftover food and stuff. Because it might want one of those.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2469s - 2470s]
Yeah. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2470s - 2471s]
They're easier.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2471s - 2476s]
Yeah. We'll get one of those then. So then what then what you need to get is so you can do packet.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2477s - 2478s]
I think they're behind here.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2479s - 2479s]
Mhmm.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2483s - 2494s]
Oh, sorry. Ma'am? Obviously, you've got stuff like I feel like we can just get some of those things over time or any. It can buy something if you want something or you can offer something.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2494s - 2495s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2495s - 2497s]
You can get a better filter than the ones in it.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2498s - 2503s]
But I think if we pick carefully on the fish that we have, you get ones that don't poo too much. Yeah. Then that is better.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2503s - 2507s]
Obviously, but all sorts of things like like Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2507s - 2509s]
Like these to clean.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2510s - 2511s]
Like the. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2511s - 2512s]
Like,

👤 あなた [2516s - 2520s]
Is that to suck up some of the dirty water or something? Cleaner. With pump.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2522s - 2524s]
So that might be handy, Dan. Fresh water and salt water

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2525s - 2525s]
Alright.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2526s - 2527s]
So

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2527s - 2536s]
Cleaner. See. Blade, corner glass cleaner blade, flat cleaning pad, flat cleaning sponge. Planter. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2536s - 2539s]
So that's quite good. So you put it on them and you can feed the edges.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2539s - 2541s]
That's good. That is really good, actually. What's that for?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2543s - 2544s]
It's all scraped.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2551s - 2552s]
I'm talking to my dog.

👤 あなた [2554s - 2555s]
Not wanna go to the pets.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2560s - 2561s]
41, my cat.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2561s - 2566s]
Yeah. So that's quite It's subtle. Isn't it? Yeah. Oh, I guess you probably have to replace the bits.

👤 あなた [2566s - 2579s]
Yeah. So we I mean, some of the bits like this, we might as well get today with the tank to get the ten percent Get the boring bits essentially. Not the boring bits, know, I mean, the functional parts of it. Yeah. But then you want how much if that's like the best option if there's like way too big things online and what's that.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2579s - 2581s]
That seems quite good that you can get corners, though.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2581s - 2582s]
Though.

👤 あなた [2582s - 2589s]
Oh, yeah. But, I mean, yeah, this so that'd be what that'd be £9 well. Less than that because we're gonna be buying it with other stuff.

👤 あなた [2592s - 2595s]
Do we need a do we need a and net.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2598s - 2601s]
Well, fish net. Oh, I don't need a dirty old one. I don't think you really need

👤 あなた [2602s - 2612s]
You need to catch the fish for some reason. Or scoop out a dead fish. Yeah. Just a little small one like that will do it. $1.70 isn't cost anything.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2612s - 2613s]
Think probably choose that.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2613s - 2613s]
It can give you money.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2613s - 2620s]
Just say, hey. What things are you gonna need? There's things like this, like, the at the safe

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2621s - 2627s]
So the whichever one it is, it's just too make your tap water safe.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2628s - 2629s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2629s - 2631s]
I think it's that one that's needed.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2635s - 2637s]
How long does it last?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2637s - 2645s]
And basically, whenever you top up water, you have to put, like, a bit of this in it as well. So my for you to add five mil for every 10 liters.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2645s - 2647s]
Of newly added tacos.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2647s - 2656s]
And how many liter tank is it? Thirty liters. So five mil every tense, you need 20 mil. 100 mil box. Use a fifth of that in the first

👤 あなた [2657s - 2662s]
And how often does it does it tell you after you need to do it? I think you're supposed to.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2662s - 2663s]
I mean,

👤 あなた [2675s - 2678s]
You also got s Rachel. Got water pods and waste worm.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2678s - 2684s]
Yeah. He said that then they're better for, like, well, those are fresh water ones, but yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2684s - 2684s]
He didn't really

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2685s - 2685s]
Oh, yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2685s - 2686s]
Rate some of the stuff.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2687s - 2689s]
No. He should be doing that. It's just half a little bit. Yeah.

👤 あなた [2694s - 2695s]
And then food obviously as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2698s - 2701s]
You should aim for weekly or biweekly changes on a quarter.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2701s - 2709s]
So we do use five mils. So if we use 20 to start off with, we then use five mil every week. Or every four. Right?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2710s - 2719s]
Which means there'd be another 80, which would be sixteen changes, sixteen weeks. That's, like, maybe most of it. Well,

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2720s - 2722s]
That could probably last, like, nearly a year, couldn't it?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2727s - 2735s]
Baseline, biweekly, more fish, more frequent changes. Messy fish at god is more heavy planting.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2735s - 2738s]
Juices nitrate to allow less frequent changes.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2739s - 2740s]
So if you have real.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2740s - 2741s]
Which will

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2741s - 2744s]
Okay. Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2744s - 2747s]
So you're gonna get them.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2749s - 2753s]
Put to get and you can choose fish food.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2773s - 2775s]
Any uneaten food with a net?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2776s - 2778s]
To make we do want to get to that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2779s - 2782s]
But if we have a little shrimp at the bottom, eating all the food,

👤 あなた [2783s - 2789s]
Maybe you know I guess if you just You know harm. It's only $1.70. It we'd have to get your hand in with that.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2793s - 2800s]
Do you wanna get that kind of thing yet or not? It's quite a lot of money, isn't it? Well, twist and script Twist Twist and automatically oh, $25.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2800s - 2803s]
Yes. Sorry. Well, all I'm thinking is that we get 10% off.

👤 あなた [2803s - 2806s]
And the more we buy, the cheaper it is everything is.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2807s - 2813s]
No. 10% of £10 is the same whether you're buying £10 on its own or you're buying spending £210.

👤 あなた [2813s - 2815s]
When you get one voucher though?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2815s - 2817s]
Yeah. Yeah. That's I meant. Yeah.

👤 あなた [2817s - 2822s]
That's what I So it wouldn't go. It's cheaper than buying it in multiple trips. But not if you can get something like that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2824s - 2827s]
Yeah. Well, maybe so, but

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2832s - 2835s]
Oh, slide from all, actually. Slide for more, I guess.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2842s - 2845s]
This is all, like, your boring stuff. That's why they cover it up.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2845s - 2850s]
Gravel cleaner with pump That's for have the tanks over 60 liters. Delta thermoheater.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2850s - 2853s]
Sixty liters. So bottom one, eight pound pounds.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2854s - 2855s]
Prime gravel cleaner.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2856s - 2859s]
Because that's actually fair. That's when you get loads of ringing stuff in the box and some

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2872s - 2873s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2876s - 2877s]
Five and one.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2901s - 2904s]
How much is that? The five in one as as well, probably.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2904s - 2905s]
How much is it? 6.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2905s - 2911s]
Yes. That is cheaper, isn't it? Look. It looks exactly oh, and it's got has it got net as well? A spoon?

👤 あなた [2911s - 2914s]
It doesn't have a corner piece. It's got a plant for, which is what that is, means.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2915s - 2920s]
It have a corner piece. That's not the only one. This is the first one.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2926s - 2928s]
It's gonna just easy. Nineteen nineteen nine.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2932s - 2933s]
Nine nineties.

👤 あなた [2934s - 2936s]
About to just get that so we can wrap it as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2939s - 2940s]
I just think I even too much that because

👤 あなた [2942s - 2948s]
Well, We should as I say, we get the functional stuff, and then you can come and pick the fun stuff. That's okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2948s - 2949s]
Alright.

👤 あなた [2949s - 2953s]
It has a birthday, so do we need the algae cleaning magnets?

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [2953s - 2954s]
An algae.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [2954s - 2955s]
We know? Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [2963s - 2966s]
Maybe the tank's not big enough for one of those, Rachel. We don't need

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [2966s - 2974s]
Up to 65 meters. Yeah. We're now handy because you can just move it around, can't you? It's the best way of cleaning. I think it might be handy to get that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [2974s - 2979s]
Let's just check that. Can you check online and see if it's a good albuterine magnet? Is that is the kind of thing

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [3003s - 3009s]
Now we sure can get one for $4.99 like a squarely one. Mhmm. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [3019s - 3020s]
It's 12 pounds, though.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [3924s - 3929s]
Omi was never replied. It's like you're on the kids team, and they didn't even reply.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [4121s - 4123s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [4142s - 4147s]
And those are not cheaper things. They're like $60 or something, $50.60 grand. Something bad.
