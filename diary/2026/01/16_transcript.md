🎤 SPEAKER_1 [13s - 18s]
No. There's two people in this room. Okay? So I appreciate I'm sorry that you don't want it to have. I couldn't hear it.

👤 あなた [18s - 20s]
No. It's not I'm sorry you you don't want it to have it.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [20s - 22s]
It is factually, objectively No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [23s - 32s]
Anti superb. I'm sorry. I recognize there's two people. I'm happy with it loud. You not happy with it loud. So I said, I'm sorry. Mhmm. I acknowledge that you would like to have it quite The reason I had it

👤 あなた [32s - 34s]
Actually, pointless apology, missus.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [34s - 35s]
Oh, no. You won't listening to me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [35s - 42s]
Yeah. I'm sure. You weren't you weren't listening to you. You didn't even let me finish my sentence. You didn't let me get to the actual that was like because

👤 あなた [42s - 43s]
That was like that was like a no.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [43s - 47s]
That was like a prelittle bit to my full sentence. Yeah. But that disqualified it because

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [48s - 48s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [48s - 48s]
No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [48s - 52s]
But you didn't know what I about say. You literally didn't know what I was about to say.

👤 あなた [53s - 63s]
Oh, I'm saying No. I'm happy to hear what you're we're about to see next. But the thing you said, first of all, makes me not want to hear it because I'm sorry that you want it quieter.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [63s - 65s]
Oh, that's what you heard.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [65s - 70s]
It? Gotta say it again. No. No. I'm finishing a conversation because I don't think that's fair.

👤 あなた [71s - 72s]
I that's That's exactly what you said.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [72s - 80s]
Yeah. Because that's like me saying, the black dog and you're going, wow. You're racist. You're talking about a dog being black.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [80s - 84s]
He's not black. And I was like, hold on. Let me finish the rest of the sentence. And you'll hear what I'm saying.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [85s - 90s]
Black dog was covered in ink because he ran through the ink factory.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [90s - 94s]
And you've made an assumption from three words No.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [94s - 96s]
Or what the rest of us is I'm sorry.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [96s - 108s]
You assumed I'm saying, well, you don't like it, but this is that that's not literal. I was going to say I was about to move into explaining why it was loud and apologize for the fact that it was loud.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [108s - 118s]
I had music, the stuff playing, blah blah blah. I'm sorry. Blah blah blah. But you didn't even let me. You just made that assumption from the very beginning after I said a few words.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [118s - 123s]
The hot like, why would I wanted to I would be more receptive to the second half if it was for the

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [124s - 127s]
Well, you're gonna have to make do with the the false apology at the beginning.

👤 あなた [127s - 127s]
You what?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [130s - 131s]
Honey

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [131s - 135s]
Well, you're not getting If I stopped there and then started talking about cars, maybe that would have been a false apology.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [135s - 143s]
If I actually got to finish the sentence that I leaked literally was only the first third of the way through, then you would have heard the extra words coming up my mat.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [143s - 145s]
Babe. Blinding.

👤 あなた [145s - 146s]
We're just reflecting on a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [147s - 148s]
So funny.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [148s - 148s]
Little

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [152s - 161s]
Made a decision about the first bit of the thing that I said, even though I hadn't actually finished my sentence. I repeatedly told you, let me finish my sentence, and you don't hear what I was gonna say.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [161s - 171s]
But you're repeatedly telling me that I'm saying something. Well, I was saying you didn't hear my whole sentence. I was just ludicrous. So I think that's probably as far as we can go with it.

👤 あなた [255s - 256s]
Yep. Thank you.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [335s - 346s]
Can I see something that I'm concerned about? Is Yep. How these days cables are charging Yeah. Are c to c or wherever they are.

Mhmm. And so it's just that case of like

👤 あなた [365s - 368s]
What do you mean? Like, plugging in our plane?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [368s - 371s]
Into a socket? Plane and, like, whatever. Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [373s - 375s]
And also headphones and stuff as well.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [375s - 376s]
It's like kind of

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [377s - 381s]
I think they give you, like, headphones. It's just if you want your own ones that are more comfy.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [382s - 386s]
But No. You know? Yeah.

👤 あなた [389s - 392s]
