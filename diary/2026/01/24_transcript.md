Of course, that this game had publicly sports, and they bought on that, like, the superstar. Gone actually or whatever. Yeah.

Pedro.

👤 あなた [3535s - 3537s]
Well, there's no doubt a bit of complacency from their team.

👤 あなた [3538s - 3547s]
But if I was playing for Chelsea against Cardiff and I'm not in the starting 11, I'm gonna show him what I can do. I wanna show the manager that I should be considered for starting game.

👤 あなた [3547s - 3555s]
But none of them did. They were against league one, league leaders, and none of them really Besides concerned, showed any urgency.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [3555s - 3561s]
So the only reason that this people got scores would have players that came on. So so who's scored? Two are from Ghana show. Yeah.

That's although they are full with 10 of them, which should usually be, like, Alright.

👤 あなた [3630s - 3638s]
The only reason that we're 8%. I wonder the way it is because they got off to bit of a slower start and that they're now getting into this stride a bit.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [1004s - 1026s]
General, I think everyone else would have been a bit understanding there thinking he wouldn't have got out of the injury him. He injured himself falling down. It would if wasn't for the fact that there was quite a few instances between the two already, and the ref wasn't protecting Salik at all. No. And so everyone was a bit frustrated at that. Because if as you say, if you would have booked or had a word with him Yeah. You know, he might have been a bit more gentle though. I feel sorry for them.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1026s - 1032s]
