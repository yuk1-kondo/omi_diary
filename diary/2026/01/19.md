The user talks about a new space simulation game called Spacecraft, wondering if it will be the next major title in the genre. They describe it as an online-focused space exploration experience, while noting that the developers on Discord emphasize a strong solo experience. The user reflects that space can feel empty in solo play and suggests that if the studio can master solo gameplay and later expand into an MMO-style shared space operation, it could be successful.

Rachel records a long, investigative-style video addressing abuse, fraud, cover‑ups, and spiritual manipulation within the charismatic Christian church, focusing heavily on allegations against prophetic minister Sean Bolz and the leadership culture that enabled him. She explains that he was her “white rabbit” into a broader rabbit hole of corruption, and says she has gathered previously unseen evidence and victim testimonies over the past year. Rachel criticizes prominent leaders such as Bill Johnson, Kris Vallotton, and others in revival/prophetic circles for publicly endorsing Bolz while privately distancing themselves without warning their congregations, framing this as “cover up culture.” She emphasizes that she still believes in spiritual gifts but insists on exposing systemic problems that create and protect abusive leaders, calling for accountability, public rebuke, and reforms in how prophecy and revival culture are practiced. She notes the personal cost of doing this work, anticipates slander against herself, and frames the series as temporary before she returns to her usual Bible study content.
