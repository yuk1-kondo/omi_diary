    "title": "Critique Of Prophetic Use Of Social Media Data",
    "overview": "The speakers, led primarily by one main commentator, analyze and criticize alleged prophetic practices of a figure named Sean (often referred to as Sean Bolz). They focus on how he appears to rely on publicly available social media information and usernames instead of genuine supernatural insight. Examples include misreading or guessing usernames (like \"TerryBishop911\" and \"BabsElrick\"), confusion over whether names are real or just handles, and repeatedly pulling very specific biographical details from people’s Facebook pages and personal testimony videos. A friend of the commentator, Steven Kozar, is referenced and quoted as he systematically shows how Sean’s words to an individual named Dennis at the Azusa Now event match Dennis’ existing online testimony and Facebook profile (Ukrainian background, move to Washington, difficult youth, bullying, drugs, juvenile detention, ministry name “Awakening Generation,” current location). The argument is that Sean combines highly specific past and present details that are easy to data-mine with vague, non-specific future prophecies, forming a pattern the commentator calls manipulative, abusive, and fraudulent, especially when people like Dennis may base life decisions and fundraising appeals on these “words.”",
