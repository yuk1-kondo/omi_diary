    "title": "Rachel and Partner Plan Upcoming Sundays At Church",
    "overview": "Rachel and her partner discuss scheduling responsibilities for two upcoming Sundays at their church. Rachel insists that one of those Sundays must be a breakfast church service because she cannot cover two consecutive weeks of kids’ church due to a lack of leaders. The user has already offered preaching dates to Johnny and Steve, including a standalone sermon topic about being servant-hearted and another on \"what do we believe by faith,\" and is reluctant to overuse Johnny or push Steve’s next preaching slot too far back (possibly to May). They consider designating the flexible-topic Sunday as breakfast church so Rachel and her partner might briefly attend before traveling, and Rachel notes they must confirm details with Lois and Rana, who organize things. They also consider using the first Sunday as a calm family morning before heading off, even if the boys don’t attend church that day.",
