    "title": "Rachel and Partner Resolve Noise Disagreement",
    "overview": "Rachel and her partner argue about the volume of some audio in their room. The partner objects to the loud noise, while Rachel insists she acknowledged there are two people in the room and was in the middle of a full apology and explanation when she was interrupted. They debate whether her initial wording was a \"pointless\" or insincere apology, with Rachel arguing that he judged her intent before she finished her sentence and using an analogy to illustrate making assumptions from partial information. Eventually they drop the dispute and shift to a practical topic: concerns about USB-C charging cables and headphone connections on a plane, discussing that some planes still use USB-A ports, and that they can research the specific aircraft type from a screenshot to see what power and port options are available.",
