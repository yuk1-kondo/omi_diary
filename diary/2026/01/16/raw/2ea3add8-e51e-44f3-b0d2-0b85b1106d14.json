    "title": "Rachel Shares Rick and Morty Voice Rituals",
    "overview": "Rachel discusses her voice acting process and warm-up rituals for performing Rick in Rick and Morty. She explains the specific lines she repeatedly uses to get into character, such as the more conversational \"Caribbean Queen, written by Hugh Jackman, age 16\" and the heightened, angry launch line \"Touch my shit and die. That's not a threat from me. That's how advanced my shit is.\" She demonstrates how these lines help her shift between tones and then transitions into delivering in-character dialogue as Rick and Morty. Rachel also summarizes recent news about co-creator Dan Harmon addressing his strained relationship with Justin Roiland, noting that they have not spoken since 2019, tensions around writers brought in from Community, and Justin’s unhappiness during production. The clip blends behind-the-scenes acting insight with commentary on the show’s creators and short in-character sketches.",
