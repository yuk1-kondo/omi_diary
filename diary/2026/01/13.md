### 📚 AI活用と生徒情報管理の運用方針検討

**時間**: 13:37

**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-8511f4db)

教育現場での生徒情報の扱いとAI活用についての打ち合わせ。これまで1年生・2年生の情報を手入力していた背景を踏まえ、話者は「生徒が持つ知識と同レベルの情報収集を紙で続けるのは限界なので、最低限公務系システム（デジタル）で管理してほしい」と強く要望している。また、その情報を学校としてどう下ろして現場運用するかは、別の担当（多分「海」に話してもらうのが良い）と整理する方針が述べられる。別の話者からは、AIチームと連携し、後日案内するフロントエンドを使ってもらうことで初見のベースデータを扱えるようにするという業務フロー案も出ている。さらに、2月4日と2月18日頃に大会があり、それに合わせて1年生の対応スケジュール（2月紹介・8月末紹介など）を意識した時期感の共有がなされているが、具体的な会議やイベントの確定時刻までは決まっていない。

### 💬 Rachel Describes Minor EV Crash Before Breakfast

**時間**: 18:17  
**カテゴリ**: real
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-1f2a8f57)

The audio captures a mix of background adverts, radio discussion, and then a real-world minor car accident involving Rachel in her new electric vehicle and a Royal Mail van. The Royal Mail driver reverses quickly down a hill into Rachel’s stationary car, cracking her number plate and possibly affecting sensors. Rachel and the driver (Chris Jones) calmly exchange details, inspect both vehicles, and note that damage appears superficial and that it is a damage-only incident with no injuries, so no police report is required. Rachel shares her phone number, plans to have the EV inspected by a garage or MOT station to check for any hidden structural or charging damage, and considers whether to involve insurance given potential impact on her policy despite it being a non-fault accident. She then continues on to a men’s breakfast gathering, where she recounts the accident, expresses frustration about it happening to a brand new car, and chats with others about EV construction, dash cams, previous accidents, fitness journeys (including her cousin Carol’s weight loss and blog), outdoor trips like Pen y Fan, and general life updates. The overall mood is mildly stressed but pragmatic and supportive, with friends reassuring her that accidents happen and helping her think through next steps.

**時間**: 19:09  
**カテゴリ**: music
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-a7273917)

Rachel and another participant reminisce about a long-running band (possibly The Enid) and its history, including touring stories, members' careers, and fan support structures like a subscription or "stand" that helped fund albums. The other participant reflects on being 19 or 20, growing up in a very right‑wing, homophobic family, and turning down an opportunity to work with the band and others out of fear and naivety, which sent their life in a completely different direction. They share anecdotes about drinking with band members at the Bell Hotel, hearing stories of touring and a member's prior work as a musical director, and Rachel comments on how fascinating the history is and how being involved would have been impactful.
