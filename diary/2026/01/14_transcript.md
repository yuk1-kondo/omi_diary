🎤 SPEAKER_2 [200s - 211s]
Okay. She did golf and one today. So funny. It's the problem is it's it's a bit like, oh, here she goes. I feel well. It's about basically, we're looking at maybe maybe.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [211s - 221s]
It's a it's a bigger situation. For the where we've got all these accreditation, the open university so at the moment, if you did in individual modules for the MTH, that's all it is.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [221s - 232s]
You don't get anything for it. We could accredit them with ECTE, so you get credits. But if you did enough credits that would be the equivalent of a master's, you wouldn't get a master's.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [233s - 253s]
You just get load of credits. Wouldn't actually give you a why But we could get with the OU Yeah. Credit them, and then stack So it's like, well, you know what? You've done all six modules Yeah. And a dissertation all separately in your own time over five years Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [253s - 255s]
We can give you a master's.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [255s - 255s]
Right.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [256s - 258s]
Which I think is brilliant.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [258s - 265s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [265s - 272s]
I could do a module or two a year. If I since you're thinking I'm gonna go do one module a year, actually if I kinda get interested, I can see the capacity they're maybe

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [287s - 295s]
But so it'd be the same in the sense that it'd be like that five years still. I was like, this is a great idea. I mean, okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [296s - 304s]
Hands go up. Why? Well, I think he's just a bit like, well, if you don't wanna do a master's, then you either wanna do it or you And I think she's just missing es her.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [324s - 334s]
The heart is we wanna spread I wanna impact the local church, and how best can we do that? Well, actually, getting as much theology out there to more people is better.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [335s - 345s]
Than getting master's degree to a few. Yeah. Because those people are probably gonna go and get somewhere anyway. Yeah. But I was I said to fit in after it, was like, well, thought it was a really good idea.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [345s - 353s]
He's like, apart from that, Alberta's one. I said, well, I thought it was a really good idea. So he's like, well, set it out. I said, I can just think of people, but it would be a good way.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [382s - 385s]
And he said to me today, I said, oh, sometimes I'm just trying to work out.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [385s - 397s]
It's just the final processes, and sometimes I think things are actually teaching to you decisions, but then it kind of comes and I'm thinking, is this gonna get sorted? He's said, you know, feel confident to delegate things and say, need to sort you need to sort that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [397s - 398s]
And I'm there thinking

👤 あなた [399s - 401s]
I'm not getting paid for that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [401s - 407s]
I'm not getting for paid for that. I think that's what the teaching team should teaching teams should be telling me what they want to happen.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [407s - 408s]
Why you tell tell them that then?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [408s - 409s]
But that's not the happen.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [422s - 430s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [430s - 444s]
Label. People think we're admin. And he's right that especially for, like, we're programs coordinator managers. We manage the programs. We make them happen. We're given a syllabus

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [444s - 444s]
Mhmm.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [444s - 446s]
The teachers just turn up.

👤 あなた [446s - 461s]
Oh, well. Just really six. So so so so so so so administration teams is a bit confusing because people think that what we'd we'd probably do is the advent of it when actually what we're doing is making up a lot of decisions.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [462s - 469s]
Right. Well, we are making all the decisions. And I I did replenish delete it and think I well, yeah, I see you too as not do that.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [469s - 480s]
Feel like I do sometimes do that, I actually don't mind that. Because I do things that I'd rather have more admin than I would I'm not I don't really wanna be doing all this decision making, frankly. I'm quite happy to do less.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [481s - 490s]
I I feel this role is quite professional, and it's a lot more than what I'm being paid to do. But equally, I feel it's a gift to be able to work there.
