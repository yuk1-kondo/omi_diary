Is spacecraft the next big space sim? The picture is basically online space exploration. Yes. I did say online at the Discord where they say they're focusing on the solo experience and welcome it. I mean, with spaces like this, space can feel quite an empty place when it's a solo game. If they can master that solo experience, then have the MMO then turning all around to an actual space operation, not works in a playtest. I'm over to Sorry, mate. We're full.

That's right. I'll make it Tony. Who's Tony? Who's Tony? Kelly's brother.
