Is spacecraft the next big space sim? The picture is basically online space exploration. Yes. I did say online at the Discord where they say they're focusing on the solo experience and welcome it. I mean, with spaces like this, space can feel quite an empty place when it's a solo game. If they can master that solo experience, then have the MMO then turning all around to an actual space operation, not works in a playtest. I'm over to Sorry, mate. We're full.

👤 あなた [51s - 55s]
That's right. I'll make it Tony. Who's Tony? Who's Tony? Kelly's brother.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [0s - 6s]
Now let's try the sunfish. This is difficult. You guys have some

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [18s - 19s]
What's gonna say today?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [116s - 129s]
And away This video is not for everybody. It's very important, think, especially for the charismatic church and for Christians in churches to deal with abuse, fraud, cover up, and the devastating breadth of all.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [129s - 141s]
Sean Bowles, this guy right here, he was my white rabbit. Okay? This guy was my white rabbit. He's the rabbit I down the rabbit hole to see how bad things are in covered culture inside the charismatic church?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [142s - 168s]
The connections to all these different figures, and you of stuff, generations of abusers, fraud, and up in the charismatic church. Sean Bulls. So you're gonna go down the same rabbit hole I went down. This started early last year, and I've spent the last year dealing with and talking to victims people who've been heard and gathering evidence I've talked to many of the people that Sean victimized and spiritually abused.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [168s - 177s]
Gonna be sharing their stories. I have evidence that has never been seen by anybody before. I've gathered that evidence, and I'm gonna be sharing it along with witness testimony from multiple people.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [178s - 187s]
His victims asked me to speak out on their behalf, because the leaders in the charismatic church would not they participated, in my opinion, in cover up culture.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [188s - 249s]
Can change. I'm doing this for the jury's advocate. I love you guys. I believe in the gifts. I'm I'll tell you more about that in a second. But buckle because we're gonna go deep into the rabbit hole, and you need to hear the details because what happens is when someone like Sean is exposed, everybody just washes their hands of it and like they had no part in it. And that's not true. And if we don't show the connections then we can't fix the files. So I've gathered the evidence evidence that shows how cover up culture handled it in the in the charismatic church, not only Shambles, but many, many other situations. And And the elites all knew about it. They knew about Chambol's. The elites did, and they did nothing as far as warning their people. They left their people in the dark, people who had been prophesied to, people who've been abused. They just left them alone or in the dark. This is gonna be a long video. There will be timestamps down below to try to you navigate things because it will just get crazier and crazier. I will continue to unpack different scenarios, another witness, a different situation, tying it into another leader. This is just the way it's gonna be. I hate this video. I hope you hate it too. This is all lame and terrible.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [249s - 255s]
This is not my normal ministry stuff. I don't plan to do the minister. I just wanna help.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [258s - 259s]
No worries. No way.

👤 あなた [260s - 262s]
This is the job in the

👤 あなた [269s - 271s]
Is this Murray, yours down here, Rachel?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [273s - 274s]
No. Enough.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [307s - 309s]
Right. We've we've got a Charles in the shower. Yeah?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [310s - 310s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [312s - 314s]
We can't any water.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [331s - 331s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [361s - 367s]
Sexual harassment from Charleston not only the failure of respective leaders in the war and protect their own people.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [372s - 400s]
But the fact that there's a system of leadership inside system of revival culture and a way of handling prophecy that I believe will create men like over again fine.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [415s - 432s]
But glean what you can Find what you can that is beneficial to you. Please consider how to stop this stuff from happening in your life and try to zero. So it's of fake profit.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [432s - 444s]
And tell them about fake healing all this other stuff. Has to stop. And it has to stop now. So I think this video will help that. I do believe that that's why I'm doing it for benefit and blessing of the Charismatic Church.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [444s - 446s]
So I'm exposing a whole bunch of corruption.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [449s - 456s]
I because I've done a series of videos now, and I'll continue the series for a while, then I'll stop the series, get back bible studies, and I will be very happy to do that.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [457s - 466s]
Because of that, though, there is going to be slander coming against me personally because, you know, shoot the messenger kind of thing. So just wanna make a couple things really clear. I believe in the gift.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [467s - 522s]
I'm not advocating against the use of the gifts of the spirit of prophecy or hone, or any other things. You've also done the book to me improperly, which you know, cover up culture videos by making just zero monetization. So every crew, we can make a million views it will not be actually like to be strong. Okay? And I'd be so that we gain seen as cleansed by the Lord. If there's real repent,

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [527s - 530s]
Here, I'm trying to follow what the Bible tells us to do Distance yourself from them.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [546s - 553s]
No. That's not what it says. Pretend that you have no part in their in their ministry or you didn't raise them up to go. That's not what it says.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [554s - 564s]
Says rebuke them in the presence of all. So that the rest may stand in fear. That is this kind of rebuke we're breaking right now about shuttles.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [573s - 578s]
And it's a cause exaggerate my my spiritual I better not do any of that stuff.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [578s - 586s]
And would need that to come with more of the charismatic church big time. Okay. Let's go down the rabbit hole.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [593s - 595s]
Sean Boles.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [596s - 599s]
This is the guy Sean Boles. He's the guy that you're the guy.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [643s - 663s]
About things that you've done recently or or hopes that you have in your heart. And and he says it's all coming from God. He's like, I've never met you, but I I know So he can through this what is overly a gimmick.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [665s - 674s]
He convinced countless people that he was a prophet. This was especially true with Bill John flat for him at a suicide.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [676s - 709s]
Now this flat Let me show it to you. At this event in 2016, this where Bill Johnson put that's Bill Johnson on stage ever shuffled in front of countless people in this this event was was a big he gets up there and he starts calling people out. It will let at some videos of this later, calling people out in the audience. He calls out an name. He he tells them their life story. He tells them God's calling them to be a missionary to this place and go here here. And it was just amazing, amazing event.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [711s - 715s]
Look at how those I want us to understand that Bill Johnson has responsibility for Sean Boles.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [725s - 729s]
That's how we got introduced. Why? These people know and trust Bill Johnson.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [729s - 743s]
Bill Johnson is one of the most respected leaders in the parasitic church now. He is seen as a safe man, a man who is gentle, who is incredibly loving, who never said a bad word about anybody. This is his reputation. He would like to move.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [744s - 750s]
Never hear him say a bad word about a single human being his entire life. Which, of course, makes it so that his congress

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [767s - 774s]
Valeton, his number two guy at Bethel, was texting one of their one of the victims of trouble, and he told them he'd show

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [777s - 788s]
This was in 01/09/2021. He says, told him, Sean Bolt, he needs to clean up his mess before he has a relationship with any of our people. I've also told our entire team that they're not

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [800s - 822s]
I'm gonna show you more of that text conversation later on in this video, but this is what is going on. There has been the endorsement, then there was the distancing privately, But yet, in 2023, Bill Johnson goes public again, and they've never and this point, in time the timeline, they never made a public statement about being any kind of problem.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [823s - 831s]
But in 2023, Bill Johnson goes with Shambles on TBN. And he says the following about Schum.

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [831s - 844s]
But, Bill, wrote the four words of this book. It's called translating God. Hearing God's voice by your and the word around world around you. But you know that this was one of the most exciting books Yeah. That you had read. Why was that?

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [845s - 852s]
Well, the book by itself is incredible. Knowing the life that backs it up Uh-huh. Adds a a power to it because it's so it's so practical.

🎤 SPEAKER_8 [853s - 854s]
It's it's what you dream of.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [855s - 865s]
It's like if if you could see if you could have a perfect relationship with the Lord and see its impact on humanity, that's what it looks like. I get excited.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [865s - 868s]
Knowing that we could actually raise up generations of people to do the same thing.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [871s - 879s]
We're going all the way to the ratable today, but Bill endorsing him like this, you will see very clearly was an atrocious and evil act.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [882s - 901s]
Atrocious and evil. He set him up as a prophet to the world. He later had Chris Chris Valeton, you know, under his under his ultimate leadership, calling even calling Sean's board to pull out a ministry. Cannot do any of our any events with us. He can be anywhere near our team.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [902s - 904s]
But publicly, they wouldn't say a word about him.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [905s - 910s]
And when they were asked about it, they made it sound like it was sort of the nebulous, and who knows what's really wrong with this guy. They bill goes and endorses him.

🎤 SPEAKER_7 [910s - 923s]
Well, book by itself is incredible knowing the life that backs it up, it adds a a power to if you could have a perfect relationship with Ford and see as the impact on human humanity.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [935s - 940s]
That's what it would look like when we find out, though, is there If in my church, somebody who's targeting the flock there that that I part of.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [941s - 949s]
I would feel the obligation to protect them, especially if you're those leaders. You're the pastor. You're the supposed prophet killed Chris is supposed to be the of devil.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [950s - 967s]
It is not protecting his people. His reputation is one of prophetic integrity. It's not it's not real. Bill's reputation is one of though Bethel's really big. They're one of most influential charismatic churches on the planet.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [967s - 975s]
As far as other people. Taking their lead, learning their practices, and trying to copy them. Which I I find to be hazardous path.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [978s - 980s]
So in

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [981s - 990s]
2022, right, a year approximately not not even quite a year before Bill Johnson goes and publicly endorses Shambol's IDN. On TVN.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [991s - 1002s]
I have a secretly recorded conversation where Stacy Campbell, another one of the prophetesses in the charismatic movement, is giving a list of all the people and the leadership who know about Sean and how dangerous Sean is
