Rachel and her partner argue about the volume of some audio in their room. The partner objects to the loud noise, while Rachel insists she acknowledged there are two people in the room and was in the middle of a full apology and explanation when she was interrupted. They debate whether her initial wording was a "pointless" or insincere apology, with Rachel arguing that he judged her intent before she finished her sentence and using an analogy to illustrate making assumptions from partial information. Eventually they drop the dispute and shift to a practical topic: concerns about USB-C charging cables and headphone connections on a plane, discussing that some planes still use USB-A ports, and that they can research the specific aircraft type from a screenshot to see what power and port options are available.

### 💬 酒粕のかす汁レシピ研究トーク

**時間**: 15:08  
**カテゴリ**: family
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-9b925651)

会話では主に酒粕を使ったかす汁作りについて話している。酒粕は特に銘柄にこだわらず日本盛などメジャーなものを使っているが、強く出すぎないよう量の調整やだし取りに悩んでいる様子が語られる。花かつおではなく、サバ節などいろいろな節が入っただし素材を使いたいという話や、「濃いだし」はあまり好まないこと、酒粕をこしてなめらかにするかどうかといった技術的な話題が出る。味付けでは、テレビで見た「牛乳を少し入れるとかす汁がまろやかになる」というアイデアを試してみて、好みの味に近づけていった経緯も共有される。味噌は合わせ味噌を使い、具材は好みで入れるが、大根や白菜、揚げなどについては向き不向きの意見が交わされ、話し手の中では「白菜はかす汁には合わない」という強い好みがある。また、分量はレシピよりも感覚で覚えるべきという考え方や、何度も作れば自転車と同じで自然に身につくという励ましもあり、家庭の味としてのかす汁の作り方を模索している雑談となっている。

Rachel discusses her voice acting process and warm-up rituals for performing Rick in Rick and Morty. She explains the specific lines she repeatedly uses to get into character, such as the more conversational "Caribbean Queen, written by Hugh Jackman, age 16" and the heightened, angry launch line "Touch my shit and die. That's not a threat from me. That's how advanced my shit is." She demonstrates how these lines help her shift between tones and then transitions into delivering in-character dialogue as Rick and Morty. Rachel also summarizes recent news about co-creator Dan Harmon addressing his strained relationship with Justin Roiland, noting that they have not spoken since 2019, tensions around writers brought in from Community, and Justin’s unhappiness during production. The clip blends behind-the-scenes acting insight with commentary on the show’s creators and short in-character sketches.

### 🙏 Rachel and User Discuss Grass and Sanctification

**時間**: 17:21  
**カテゴリ**: spiritual
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-a27e2462)

Rachel and the user have a brief spiritual/theological conversation. The user reflects on how grass in the back garden grows in spring and summer under the sun but stops growing in winter, wondering if there is an analogy there. Rachel responds with a Christian metaphor: just as grass needs the sun’s warmth to flourish, believers need Christ’s love for growth, and colder seasons can feel spiritually dormant. The user then asks how coherent this analogy is in relation to the doctrine of sanctification.
