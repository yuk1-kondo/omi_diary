Rachel and her partner argue about the volume of some audio in their room. The partner objects to the loud noise, while Rachel insists she acknowledged there are two people in the room and was in the middle of a full apology and explanation when she was interrupted. They debate whether her initial wording was a "pointless" or insincere apology, with Rachel arguing that he judged her intent before she finished her sentence and using an analogy to illustrate making assumptions from partial information. Eventually they drop the dispute and shift to a practical topic: concerns about USB-C charging cables and headphone connections on a plane, discussing that some planes still use USB-A ports, and that they can research the specific aircraft type from a screenshot to see what power and port options are available.

Rachel and the user talk about how to choose seats on an upcoming flight. They weigh paying in advance for specific seats versus taking the risk and selecting seats for free at online check-in. Rachel explains that check-in opens exactly 24 hours before departure (in this case, at 20:40 on Saturday night) and that seats are free to choose then but with less availability. They briefly mention preferred seat locations (middle aisle instead of window) and acknowledge some uncertainty about other travel-related details.

### 💬 酒粕のかす汁レシピ研究トーク

会話では主に酒粕を使ったかす汁作りについて話している。酒粕は特に銘柄にこだわらず日本盛などメジャーなものを使っているが、強く出すぎないよう量の調整やだし取りに悩んでいる様子が語られる。花かつおではなく、サバ節などいろいろな節が入っただし素材を使いたいという話や、「濃いだし」はあまり好まないこと、酒粕をこしてなめらかにするかどうかといった技術的な話題が出る。味付けでは、テレビで見た「牛乳を少し入れるとかす汁がまろやかになる」というアイデアを試してみて、好みの味に近づけていった経緯も共有される。味噌は合わせ味噌を使い、具材は好みで入れるが、大根や白菜、揚げなどについては向き不向きの意見が交わされ、話し手の中では「白菜はかす汁には合わない」という強い好みがある。また、分量はレシピよりも感覚で覚えるべきという考え方や、何度も作れば自転車と同じで自然に身につくという励ましもあり、家庭の味としてのかす汁の作り方を模索している雑談となっている。
