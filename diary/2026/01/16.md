### 💬 Rachel and Partner Resolve Noise Disagreement

**時間**: 07:21  
**カテゴリ**: romantic
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-e20e2df6)

Rachel and her partner argue about the volume of some audio in their room. The partner objects to the loud noise, while Rachel insists she acknowledged there are two people in the room and was in the middle of a full apology and explanation when she was interrupted. They debate whether her initial wording was a "pointless" or insincere apology, with Rachel arguing that he judged her intent before she finished her sentence and using an analogy to illustrate making assumptions from partial information. Eventually they drop the dispute and shift to a practical topic: concerns about USB-C charging cables and headphone connections on a plane, discussing that some planes still use USB-A ports, and that they can research the specific aircraft type from a screenshot to see what power and port options are available.

They briefly mention preferred seat locations (middle aisle instead of window) and acknowledge some uncertainty about other travel-related details.

### 💬 酒粕のかす汁レシピ研究トーク

**時間**: 15:08  
**カテゴリ**: family
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-9b925651)

会話では主に酒粕を使ったかす汁作りについて話している。酒粕は特に銘柄にこだわらず日本盛などメジャーなものを使っているが、強く出すぎないよう量の調整やだし取りに悩んでいる様子が語られる。花かつおではなく、サバ節などいろいろな節が入っただし素材を使いたいという話や、「濃いだし」はあまり好まないこと、酒粕をこしてなめらかにするかどうかといった技術的な話題が出る。味付けでは、テレビで見た「牛乳を少し入れるとかす汁がまろやかになる」というアイデアを試してみて、好みの味に近づけていった経緯も共有される。味噌は合わせ味噌を使い、具材は好みで入れるが、大根や白菜、揚げなどについては向き不向きの意見が交わされ、話し手の中では「白菜はかす汁には合わない」という強い好みがある。また、分量はレシピよりも感覚で覚えるべきという考え方や、何度も作れば自転車と同じで自然に身につくという励ましもあり、家庭の味としてのかす汁の作り方を模索している雑談となっている。

### 🎬 Rachel Shares Rick and Morty Voice Rituals

**時間**: 16:29  
**カテゴリ**: entertainment
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-2ea3add8)

Rachel discusses her voice acting process and warm-up rituals for performing Rick in Rick and Morty. She explains the specific lines she repeatedly uses to get into character, such as the more conversational "Caribbean Queen, written by Hugh Jackman, age 16" and the heightened, angry launch line "Touch my shit and die. That's not a threat from me. That's how advanced my shit is." She demonstrates how these lines help her shift between tones and then transitions into delivering in-character dialogue as Rick and Morty. Rachel also summarizes recent news about co-creator Dan Harmon addressing his strained relationship with Justin Roiland, noting that they have not spoken since 2019, tensions around writers brought in from Community, and Justin’s unhappiness during production. The clip blends behind-the-scenes acting insight with commentary on the show’s creators and short in-character sketches.

**カテゴリ**: spiritual
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-a27e2462)

Rachel and the user have a brief spiritual/theological conversation. The user reflects on how grass in the back garden grows in spring and summer under the sun but stops growing in winter, wondering if there is an analogy there. Rachel responds with a Christian metaphor: just as grass needs the sun’s warmth to flourish, believers need Christ’s love for growth, and colder seasons can feel spiritually dormant. The user then asks how coherent this analogy is in relation to the doctrine of sanctification.

**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-fb0c9ef8)

Rachel delivers an audio teaching for God First, emphasizing that spiritual commands are not about self-salvation but about choosing where one lives from spiritually. She contrasts passive drifting with intentionally standing near Christ and His life, explaining that while God is the one who changes people, individuals are responsible for positioning themselves close to Him. She reassures listeners that feeling spiritually cold may reflect a season rather than failure, and encourages them to stay near the 'warmth' of God rather than drifting away.

Rachel and the user chat informally about several household and family topics. They first discuss airline seat reservations for an upcoming trip, weighing whether to pay extra to sit together and preferring specific configurations (three seats together on the outbound flight, and pairs on the return) while avoiding middle seats. They then mention home maintenance: the plumber was supposed to come yesterday but may arrive today instead, or Sue might come in his place. Rachel talks about planning and leading a children’s church or Bible group session, coordinating with others like Claudine and Helen, and using a video that emphasizes a traditional Christian view of marriage (Adam and Eve, man and woman) to surface any disagreements among parents. They also touch on time pressures that day, Rachel’s busy to‑do list, and the user’s idea of buying a fish tank as a present for a child, highlighting the fun of unboxing and setting it up together. Toward the end, they briefly review photos of their garden across different summers and comment on improvements and past fence damage.

### 💬 Rachel and User Plan Church Group and Fish Tank

**時間**: 20:32  
**カテゴリ**: family
**📝 STT生テキスト**: [詳細を見る](#stt-2e8a2d52)

The recording captures a long, informal day-in-the-life conversation between the user and Rachel. Early on, the user discusses with Jonathan (briefly) and then with Rachel the plan to delay launching a more formal small group at church until September because of the user’s heavy workload and upcoming graduation. In the meantime, they consider starting a low-prep, once-a-month discussion group based on recent sermons, with Rachel offering to find some simple question prompts and possibly involve one or two other trusted people to share hosting/leading. The user also talks about their dissertation and an April deadline, plus an additional essay on a passage in Ezekiel.

Later, the user and Rachel have an in-depth discussion about church leadership processes, particularly around Ben and Ellen’s potential ministry/planting role and how this was communicated to Steve and Lois. They debate whether key pastoral people should have been consulted earlier, how to handle Steve’s feedback without devaluing his input, and how to balance transparency with the fact that Steve and Lois don’t carry final leadership responsibility.

The rest of the recording follows the couple running errands: setting up a Pets at Home VIP app to get 10% off, visiting Pets at Home to choose a fish tank and necessary equipment for Elliot’s future tropical fish (tank, filter, water treatment, cleaning tools, decor, shrimp/suckerfish options, and test strips), and then going to another shop to look for wool and possibly a heater for a cold room. During this time they also coordinate with a plumber (James) and the letting agent/landlord contact Catherine about missed and rescheduled visits, and briefly mention upcoming football watching at the user’s dad’s house. The conversation ends with them bringing the new aquarium home and rearranging space for it.

**📋 アクションアイテム**:
- [ ] Create a simple monthly sermon discussion group over the summer
- [ ] Ask one or two trusted people to help host the summer sermon discussion group
- [ ] Interview several pastors about how their practice works out for the dissertation
- [ ] Send the first dissertation chunk to supervisor before the next meeting
