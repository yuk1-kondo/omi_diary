👤 あなた [0s - 7s]
Hello? 16 it is, please. Sure. Is there a little tap on the app for you. Cheers.

👤 あなた [15s - 18s]
You suck. You suck.

👤 あなた [103s - 103s]
As impossible.

👤 あなた [157s - 159s]
What is this all this sprinkled food?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [267s - 271s]
Trees, let's go home. Yeah. I need a bath.

👤 あなた [288s - 290s]
Something else. No.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [290s - 291s]
I I wanna talk to the manager.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [296s - 305s]
You in charge? Yeah. I'm Jay Gunn. Hey. Bradley Cooper carved that dash. What What's up with that last maximal velocity?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [305s - 307s]
You didn't like it? I thought was great.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [307s - 314s]
You're ruining my childhood. We were just still ongoing up eating a screen time with stupid comic relief characters and took more cool shit in the story?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [315s - 319s]
Guys, I'm a fan too. Why do think Warner Brothers poke me behind that desk, you know?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [319s - 322s]
So you can pitch Batman ideas to yourself? Exactly. Exactly.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [322s - 337s]
And you know what I've learned? Making movies isn't easy. The next Maximum Velocity movie has been rewritten 40 times, 30 by me. Now we'll spend 5 years and a half 1,000,000,000 making it. But in the end, no one will make fans like you like it? A fucking miracle.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [337s - 341s]
No. But the next time of the velocity Bill needs is us.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [341s - 342s]
I'd like to see you.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [342s - 344s]
Time to fix this broken franchise.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [344s - 347s]
Good luck. Doing anything with that stretch. It's watermarks.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [362s - 364s]
I don't know. His script is pretty good.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [365s - 375s]
Dad. Woah. What's that? The moody line. It makes movies at the speed of thought. I invented it during the title sequence Let's see what James Gunn had cooking.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [389s - 398s]
Yikes. Citizen King doesn't strike again. Oh, he wails The Movie Lizer uses a prompt driven CPU. I just type whatever tweaks I want, and it auto generates the rest.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [398s - 408s]
Tell her yeah. No. Make it lose that bad guy. Here, this one's been cool since the third movie. Let's kill two we meet again, Fruvotree.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [408s - 410s]
Wait where the guns come from.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [432s - 433s]
Messing with important

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [433s - 443s]
Oh, fuck the fuck off, Jerry. Formula driven save the cash bullshit is what killed the last couple of movies. That's right, Morty. We're gonna make the people care about the robo trees again.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [443s - 444s]
Movilizer. Make us care

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [515s - 522s]
How are we gonna get out of here? The mobilizer might eject us once the story is over. Gary, Tyson, we skip to the end, and everything works out.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [522s - 531s]
I don't think I can, guys. It's like the script is 3,000 pages and counting. Also, there's an arrow thing bleeping that says antagonist not count, and no third act.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [531s - 537s]
Without an ending, you'll be stuck in the movie forever. Goddamn it. Well, you cut a bunch of stuff out.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [537s - 542s]
Willie nilly, out What did you expect? Look. I understand story. Let me just put everything back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [542s - 548s]
That you took out. Stop. You'll only make things worse. You're a terrible writer, and you should never ever get on the keys.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [548s - 550s]
Well, excuse me for a lid.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [550s - 554s]
Alright. You killed the villain. Now I knew that. Didn't they use fire alarm, George Washington?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [558s - 565s]
Machine doesn't hate that. This is going to work. We'll bring back Barry Dissel and get this stupid thing an ending. You serve

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [572s - 574s]
Okay. All we need now is a little light ning.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [610s - 617s]
Sorta. You still need a third act. In the original graph, Baron was gonna kill Tannenbaum in front of the Robotree. Sign

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [617s - 619s]
That would have been a cool ending.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [619s - 635s]
Come. Come. Baby son of Thistle could finish what his father started? You do kind of look like him. You want me to kill Tannabal? Never works. Okay. I'll break Tannabal out of jail, reunite him with the Robotrees, and then Morty will kill him. Does the machine break recognize that as an ending? Hold on.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [637s - 645s]
It does. Kinda bleep, though. Shut up. I'm off to a jail break. What what the hell am I supposed to do? You're the new bad guy.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [645s - 648s]
But up with the henchweeds and give the Robotree something to stop.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [648s - 650s]
Something to stop? What's that? See you in the third act.

👤 あなた [656s - 658s]
Extra creatine, please.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [659s - 660s]
Yo. James Gunn.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [660s - 667s]
Oh, hi, Zack Snyder. Just saw your new cut of Superman, and word of advice, he's the man of steel, not the man of conversation.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [667s - 667s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [667s - 671s]
Do you more shots of him punching, and here's a secret move.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [671s - 674s]
Start the punch at right to speed, and then you can rip it down.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [674s - 675s]
It's not a fucking secret.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [676s - 682s]
I'm sorry, Zack Snyder. I shouldn't be lashing out at you and your biceps are the size of my head. Yes.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [682s - 694s]
But so is my heart. What's going on with you? Some fan of the velocity franchise got into the lot today, used a portal, then he just Zach, we're not losing touch with the audience.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [694s - 700s]
Are we mean, I gave notes on the goddamn Count Chocula movie this morning. Was the portal green? That's Rick Sanchez.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [700s - 711s]
Oh my god. That's the guy that sealed Nolan in the giant bookcase to, quote, unquote, punish him for Interstellar. He doesn't represent real fans. He's just the smartest man in the universe. That was sweat it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [711s - 719s]
You can't do what we do, probably. Gonna go crush some weights. One day, you're gonna wish you hit the gym like I do, James.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [727s - 731s]
Hello? Is this the Sulzable base?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [731s - 736s]
Not anymore. We're packing it in. We're try to sell all this stuff on my girlfriend's Etsy's side.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [736s - 736s]

Everyone, listen up. I'm here to get this place back up and running. I am listening. Son of Thistle.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [745s - 747s]
He does sorta have the same jacket.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [747s - 757s]
And his hand is all also a cactus. That's all the proof I need. Tell us what to do. Well, what were y'all doing before bed? This will die. Oh, you know, do you

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [757s - 763s]
Tuesday plan. We're gonna mount the ice caps. It's months in the blueprints, not that your dad ever said thank you.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [763s - 764s]
Oh, what's your name?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [764s - 775s]
Samantha. It sucks when your mom never says. Thank you, Samantha. But under me, everyone will feel appreciated. Samantha, I'm putting you in charge of

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [778s - 787s]
Oh, thank you, sir. I've been feeling so low I think it's because my mom forgot my birthday. Samantha, that will never happen again.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [788s - 792s]
On your mom now. Now let smell so much, Kim.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [799s - 801s]
Son of a bitch did it.

🎤 SPEAKER_4 [801s - 803s]
He made a movie machine. He doesn't right on the side.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [816s - 819s]
Here's your prison food, new guy. What you look for?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [819s - 823s]
Fastest crime I do commit. Any of you see an annoying little bitch in the Christmas tree?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [825s - 826s]
Please.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [827s - 829s]
Oh, please don't beat me.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [829s - 831s]
I won't. I'm here to rescue you.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [831s - 842s]
I'm not worth rescuing. I suck. I say dumb catch raises I look like a a toy designed for kids. Yeah. I have a fucking.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [843s - 849s]
Wow. More self worry than I thought. But come on. On. Everyone sucks until they don't. That's the arc of every good story. It is.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [849s - 853s]
Here's the plan. I'll start a riot, and we sneak out. I know you're not a fighter, but

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [853s - 854s]
When do we start?

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [855s - 857s]
Oh, right now?

Sure. But why are you calling from a different phone number? It's a phone for spam calls come come in into the kitchen for some lemonade.

Oh, wow. Can't pass up lemonade. The mobilizer is mine. No. One's more creative than James. Come

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [933s - 936s]
Holy shit. That was awesome.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [946s - 949s]
You did a lot too. Definitely more than I expected.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [949s - 958s]
Rick, I wanna thank you for rescuing me. Here. I want you to have this. It's a piece of me. Oh, thanks.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [958s - 962s]

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1063s - 1084s]

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1098s - 1100s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1100s - 1135s]
By turning your back on family. I don't like that. No. You could have had it all. Guys, I'm about Jeez, Louise. What did you do? The story's gone linear. When pissed off the can plug an idea into a machine when they don't care when it spits back out, but it's it's a special kind of idiot to get on the keys and write us an ending.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1135s - 1147s]
You're that idiot. But how? It's always been right in front of you. Over to my workbench. Alright. I'm there. Open the third drawer on the right, you reach way back. There should be a small orange ball.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1147s - 1155s]
What is it? Some sci fi device? Better. It's magic. We'll take more than two, three clots of water, remember to blink.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1296s - 1301s]
But let's face it. You're no mother. You're just a bad guy.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1301s - 1305s]

🎤 SPEAKER_6 [1343s - 1348s]
You saved the world from another unarmed man. Oh, oh, no. Thank died?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1348s - 1352s]
Sometimes saving the world requires complex decisions.

🎤 SPEAKER_5 [1353s - 1355s]
Decisions made by a true leader.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1378s - 1386s]
Really affected you. No. You just forgot to blame me. Still, I admit it. Making movies is hard. From now on, I'm just gonna be an impossible to please fan.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1386s - 1411s]
You said it. Let's go throw some common sections. Oh, god. Would love Sundays.

🎤 SPEAKER_0 [1452s - 1456s]
And not a wild thing. No one stopped. It's growing from the ground up. Baron Fitzgerald and his had treats looking like some

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1467s - 1477s]
set. But for the record, I do not condone using the Movilizer in this way. Is that bad? You're good to go. Can't believe I'm actually in socks. Pace champ seven. Oh, hey, LeBron.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1482s - 1492s]
Hey, guys. You know how I've been writing Raptor Born on this side? I'm ready to share with the world. Oh, well, yes. I'll just leave it on this machine till they come back.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1508s - 1509s]
Did you get any of that?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1521s - 1524s]
And then after that, I have a bunch of weight.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1524s - 1527s]
Can you guys wrap all that up? You can just say you don't wanna hang out.

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1527s - 1528s]

Lose. Rick, can you portal me to school?

🎤 SPEAKER_2 [1537s - 1539s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1556s - 1556s]
Okay.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1576s - 1588s]
Are you I got a clown of me. Did Rick? Don't tell Rick. You want me not talking? Then you better start talking. Not here. Come on. You can buy me lunch. I'm not buying you lunch.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1589s - 1592s]
What if we call it breakfast two mow?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1600s - 1614s]
And you're sure Rick won't spine this here. Yeah. He hates them all. It's kinda like I'm here so much. Or maybe me being here is why he hates it. Not actually been thinking about getting a job at American Eagle.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1614s - 1630s]
Oh, the Eagle. Man. You gonna eat that? Not really. Thanks. The road pro provides. Oh, okay. So road who are you? Do you hear from the future? Are you here to kill me? You take that game from the future.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1631s - 1639s]
Replace a guy who loves them all? I'm a traveler. I'm another dimension. Oh, you still a portal guy? What? No, man. That brings the heat.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1639s - 1646s]
I'm more slit through cracks in the multiverse. You're having cold, by the way. My morning is summer by morning more than yours.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1647s - 1651s]
Well, you don't seem like a serial killer. Then I thought I'd know.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1651s - 1652s]
But you can't stay here.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1652s - 1663s]
No sweat. You go, ma'am, just give me back your upstairs closet. And we'll that is a weird location. But just to be clear, if you do try to kill me and take over my life, I can scream very loud.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1665s - 1669s]
You never get caught doing this? Judy's basically the reason.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1669s - 1670s]
It's our superpower.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1670s - 1671s]
Nobody sees us. You're already getting

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1683s - 1690s]

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1714s - 1718s]
And don't fucking blindside me with small talk.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1719s - 1730s]
I think I'm in the clear. As long as I eat those dumplings, are you smelling my shirts? What? No. In a few dimensions, Rick gives Beth a spatially dilated walk in closet.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1731s - 1733s]
Beth is always asking for that.

🎤 SPEAKER_1 [1733s - 1733s]
Yeah.

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1733s - 1747s]
You guys are in the same dimensional neighborhood, and you can't been reality as often as Rick without the occasional bingo. And and and and and what does that lead to? But a guy like us can I the whole verse without even leaving the house?

🎤 SPEAKER_3 [1748s - 1752s]
