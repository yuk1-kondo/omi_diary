We hope you find that teaching helpful in the journey of Jesus.”**\n\nA few thoughts for you:\n\n- It sounds like you care about people growing in their faith, which is awesome. You’re trying to connect “teaching” with “the journey of Jesus.”\n- The phrase **“journey of Jesus”** is a bit unclear. Do you mean:\n  - “your journey *with* Jesus”?  \n  - “your journey *in following* Jesus”?  \n  - or learning more *about* Jesus?\n\nIf you want it to sound more natural, you could say something like:\n- “We hope this teaching helps you in your journey with Jesus.”  \n- “We hope these teachings help you grow closer to Jesus.”  \n- “We hope what you’ve learned is helpful as you follow Jesus.”\n\nIf you tell me who you’re talking to (kids, adults, church group, online audience), I can help you tweak it so it really fits your style and sounds like *you*, not just a church script."
