The brief conversation features a German-speaking participant objecting to being labeled a Nazi or right-wing extremist, insisting instead that he is a concerned citizen worried about cultural over-foreignization. He criticizes how quickly the Nazi label is used when arguments run out. Another English-speaking participant then briefly mentions having been running somewhere at the after park, but no clear connection or further context is provided.
